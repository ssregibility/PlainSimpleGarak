It's Doctor Bashir, isn't it? Of course it is. May I introduce myself?
My name is Garak. Cardassian by birth, obviously. The only one of us left on the station, as a matter of fact. So I do appreciate making new friends when I can. You are new to the station, I believe.
Ah, you know of me, then.
What a thoughtful young man. How nice that we've met.
You don't say. Doctor, you're not intimating that I'm considered some sort of... "spy," are you?
Ah! An open mind. The essence of intellect. As you may also know, I have a clothing shop nearby, so... If you should require any apparel, or merely wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable company now and then, I'm at your disposal, Doctor.
Oh, it's just Garak. Plain, simple Garak. And now, good day to you, Doctor... I'm so glad to have made such an interesting new friend today.
Plain and simple. Join me, Doctor, enhance my evening.
As a clothier, I do interest myself in what the population is wearing from day to day.
Hmmm.
Medicine? I was talking about clothes.
Intriguing... I say those two... outfits... are worth studying closely... one never knows where the next trend may come from...
I am only a simple clothing merchant...
Ladies, ladies... please... everything is negotiable...
I am only what I seem to be, a merchant seeking to make the best transaction... Let us... haggle.
Being observant, Doctor.
There's a time for levity, my young friend... and a time for genuine concern.
Doctor, I think it's time for you to take advantage of my shop. If you'll be there at exactly twenty fifty-five hours this evening, I promise to show you a suit that will make you into a new man. Am I making myself clear? I want you to buy a new suit tonight at twenty-fifty-five. Exactly.
And what business might that be?
If it requires that those I represent must take extra precautions, it becomes my concern.
I had a very demanding customer today. A Bajoran engineer who comes into the shop constantly, just to plague me...
I like to think my expertise and willingness to serve overcome any general resentment my clientele may have.
Trust is very important...
Really, Doctor... must we play this game so often? I'm no more a "spy" than you are a... a... doctor.
I'm afraid you really do let your imagination run away with you. What else can I say to convince you that I'm just plain and simple Garak?
I hope I'm not intruding, but I couldn't help noticing... what a handsome young man you are...
Doctor, what single trait would you ascribe to me and my fellow Cardassians? Would it not be our attention to detail? Do you think we simply forgot about those poor little orphans when we left Bajor?
There's obviously been a misunderstanding.
The Doctor and I did discuss the tragic circumstances of the children.
Doctor Bashir, I apologize if I've inadvertently put you in an awkward position...
I barely know the man at all.
I'm honored that I was noticed by such a great leader.
Doctor, I really am disappointed in you...
The things we talk about are for your ears only. That you would tell Commander Sisko anything I might happen to say in passing about Gul Dukat... is inappropriate and unacceptable.
Perhaps I can be of service.
I dabble with isolinear data subprocessors. It's... a hobby of mine. No more difficult than sewing on a button, actually.
Excuse me.
A simple tailoring tool. You'd be surprised how often someone needs a pair of pants let out...
It's simply a matter of knowing what you're looking for, Doctor...
I'm sorry if you're upset about the orphans. Children without parents have no status in Cardassian society. The situation is unfortunate, but... I don't make the rules.
There are always games, Doctor.
Tell me, Doctor. why do you think the Cardassians left Bajor?
Very good, Doctor. It appears all of our little get-togethers haven't been for nothing...
I believe in coincidences. Coincidences happen every day. But I don't trust coincidences.
How perfectly foolish of me.
Truth is in the eye of the beholder, Doctor. I never tell the truth because I don't believe there is such a thing. That is why I prefer the simple straight line simplicity of cutting cloth.
But you don't need me to tell you, Doctor... if you'll just notice the details. They're scattered like crumbs all over the table we regularly share. Until next time.
My dear Doctor... it all comes down to a question of loyalty. Yiri had to choose between protecting his brother or protecting the state. He chose the state... as would I, every time.
And who can we thank for those misguided words of wisdom? Sarek of Vulcan?
With sentiments like those, you wouldn't last five seconds on Cardassia.
Fishing again, Doctor? Assuming.
You're assuming I'm not a spy. Or maybe I'm an outcast spy? But I never said I was either.
Thank you for another enjoyable lunch. Doctor.
I always try to observe the fashions of visitors to the station. Personally I find this style a bit too radical, but your friend seems the type who appreciates that sort of thing.
You'd be surprised how detrimental a poor choice of fashion can be. Take this dress. It may be all the rage now... but it could quickly become tiresome, an affront to the eyes. Certain people may even find it... objectionable. And then... Nothing but rags.
Mister Quark, may I offer you some free advice? I've been in this business a long time. And I know there's nothing worse than following the wrong trend. Now you're a smart fellow. With your own inimitable style. Perhaps you should mention that to your lady friend. I'd hate to see her become... a victim of fashion.
She's chosen to associate herself with some rather flamboyant companions. It would be a tragedy if she got in the way when her friends... went out of style.
No one is threatening you. The Central Command merely wants to make sure that they have your undivided attention.
"Students" is a rather benign term for them. "Terrorists" would be more accurate.
This is all very embarrassing, Commander. The Central Command would hate to see the Federation pulled into such an insignificant and purely internal affair.
Not at all. Annoying, perhaps. Inconvenient, maybe. But dangerous? Hardly. If they were dangerous, would the Central Command entrust the situation to me, a simple tailor?
Is there a difference?
The ultimate decision is yours of course. I'm simply relaying a message.
Absolutely. Thank you for your time. If you'd like, come by the shop some day. I'm sure I have a number of suits that would look quite flattering on you.
Actually, I'm finding my time here to be most illuminating.
Kill them and all you'll be creating are martyrs.
So how do you propose to arrange this unfortunate incident?
What's the rush?
Don't. I'd hate to ruin such a nice suit.
Exile tends to wear thin after a while, even when the surroundings are as pleasant as these.
I know. A pity, really. Personally, I rather like you.
Before I became a tailor, I lived by a simple motto: "Never allow sentiment to interfere with your work." A bit of a cliche, but true nonetheless.
Well, then... Though I admit it's against my better judgement, I'm afraid I must carry out the verdict of the Central Command.
Some people should never be promoted.
And I love Cardassia. Which is why I had to do what I did.
That's the thing about love. No one really understands it, do they?
What a waste of a morning. That Galipotan freighter was scheduled to be here at oh-seven hundred and it still hasn't arrived yet. Well, I suppose that's the price of doing business with a culture that refuses to even acknowledge the concept of time... And I have to admit, they make magnificent sweaters. I hope I'm not boring you, Doctor.
Wonderful. At this rate, we should be done eating lunch just in time for dinner.
I can't believe I'm eating lunch with a man who thinks The Never-Ending Sacrifice is dull.
That's the whole point, Doctor. The repetitive epic is the most elegant form of Cardassian literature, and The Never-Ending Sacrifice is it's greatest achievement.
A Federation viewpoint if ever I heard one.
This is ridiculous. Can't you just move to the front of the line? Tell them it's a medical emergency or something.
It would only be a waste of time. When it comes to art, you're obviously a prisoner of Federation dogma and human prejudice.
Frankly Doctor, I'm getting a little tired of humoring you. There's nothing wrong with me that a little peace and privacy wouldn't cure. Now if you'll excuse me. I seem to have lost my appetite.
On the contrary. Anyone who talks about the numbing effects of liquor is severely overstating the case.
Doctor... What a pleasant surprise... I'm sorry about my little outburst at lunch, but I'll make it up to you. Please, join me.
An excellent idea. We'll go to my quarters.
The Infirmary. My dear Doctor... what kind of fool do you take me for. Give me back my bottle.
I'm not going to the Infirmary and I refuse to play this ridiculous game.
Doctor, what a pleasant surprise. I'm sorry... I must've missed the door chime.
I thought I was supposed to be the spy, Doctor.
Doctor, did anyone ever tell you that you are an infuriating pest?
Doctor, please. I'm suffering enough without having to listen to your smug Federation sympathy. You think because we have lunch together once a week, you know me? You couldn't even begin to fathom what I'm capable of.
You need to know who you're trying to save. During the Occupation, I was a Gul in the Cardassian Mechanized Infantry. We were stationed just outside the Bajoran Capital. Shortly before the withdrawal, a handful of Bajoran prisoners escaped from my custody. My aide, a man named Elim, tracked them to a Cardassian shuttle about to depart for Terok Nor. Elim got aboard, but the captain refused to let him search the ship, claiming he was under strict orders from Gul Dukat to depart immediately. So I had the shuttle destroyed. Killing the escapees... Elim... and ninety-seven Cardassian civilians.
I followed my orders. None of those prisoners got off of Bajor alive. Unfortunately, it turned out one of the passengers on the shuttle was the daughter of a prominent military official. I was stripped of my rank and commission, and exiled from Cardassia. So now you know, Doctor. I hope I haven't shattered too many of your illusions.
Look at this place. It's pathetic... to think that this is what my life has been reduced to. This sterile shell... this... Prison...
Ridiculous. I feel more clear headed than I have in the past two years. What a waste those two years have been.
But there was a time, Doctor... there was a time when I was a power. The protege of Enabran Tain himself. Do you have any idea what that means?
You don't know anything, do you? Tain was the Obsidian Order. Not even the Central Command itself dared challenge him. And I was his right hand. My future was limitless. Until I threw it away.
It was the eve of the Cardassian withdrawal. Elim and I were interrogating five Bajorans. Not one of them was older than fourteen. They were children, Doctor... They knew nothing. They lived in bombed- out rooms and scrounged for food on the streets. They were filthy and they stank. The room was freezing cold... the air was like ice... and suddenly, the whole exercise seemed utterly meaningless. All I wanted was a hot bath and a good meal. So I let them go. I gave them whatever latinum I had in my pockets, opened the door, and flung them back into the street. Elim couldn't believe his eyes. He thought I'd gone insane.
I was a fool. I should've finished the interrogation and turned them over to the troops for execution. But because I was chilly and my stomach was growling, I failed in my duty, and destroyed everything I had worked for.
To think that I actually enjoyed eating mediocre food while staring at your smug, sanctimonious face, I hate this place and I hate you.
Don't give up now, Doctor. Patience has its rewards. Now listen carefully.
Elim wasn't my aide. He was... my friend. We grew up together... We were closer than brothers. For some reason, Enabran Tain took a liking to us... Before long, Elim and I were both powerful men in the Obsidian Order... They called us the "Sons of Tain." Even the Guls feared us. And then... There was a scandal. Someone in the order was accused of letting some Bajoran prisoners escape. There were constant rumors of who was going to be implicated... fingers were being pointed at me... By then Tain had retired to the Arawath Colony. He couldn't protect me. So I panicked. I did everything in my power to make sure Elim would be blamed instead of me. I planted evidence... altered records... only to discover that he'd beaten me to it.
Elim destroyed me. Before I'd realized what was going on, I'd been sentenced to exile.	And the irony is... I deserved it. Not for the reasons they claimed, but because of what I'd tried to do to Elim. My best friend.
May I join you?
By the way, I just had the most interesting conversation with Constable Odo. It seems he was under the impression that I was a member of the Obsidian Order. He said something about keeping a closer eye on me in the future. I told him to be my guest... I have nothing to hide.
My dear Doctor, they're all true... Especially the lies.
Doctor, welcome back.
You mean the tailoring business, or the spy business? I'm joking, of course.
I've missed you, Doctor. I admit I was very concerned for your safety. Lunch just hasn't been the same without you.
There's an old saying on Cardassia, "Enemies make dangerous friends." And I fear the Dominion is going to make a very dangerous friend indeed.
Ah, Commander. I was hoping to see you before you left. I wanted to tell you how impressed I've been with you the last two years. You've run this station with strength, dignity and compassion. Well done.
Do I detect a note of bitterness in your voice?
I've given it a great deal of thought, and the only explanation I can find is that our leaders have simply gone insane.
Unfortunately, there's nothing you or I can do about it.
After all, you have your orders and as for me, I would never dream of opposing the wishes of the Central Command. A pity.
I thought you would.
Life is full of surprises.
I'm sorry, but we are rushed for time.
Not at all Doctor. Though I admit, after years of hemming dresses, a little action does seem a welcome change of pace.
All I meant was it's foolish to worry about your careers at a time like this. After all there's a good chance we're all about to be killed.
You heard me Doctor.
I'm glad to see everything's going according to plan.
Just something I read once in a book.
It looks like we won't be having lunch after all, Doctor.
Business has been a bit slow... For some reason, living under the constant threat of Dominion attack has made people less eager to invest in new clothing.
When I was young, traveling was something of a hobby for me. There are few things in life that compare with the thrill of immersing oneself in the culture of an alien world, meeting the inhabitants, earning their trust. But aside from our one brief excursion to Bajor, I don't think I've been off this station for almost three years.
Space is dangerous, doctor. You never know what might happen.
My dear doctor... you do have a vivid imagination.
Good evening, Doctor. When you're all through here, I was wondering if you might want to join me for a late snack.
Commander, I've already told the good doctor everything I know.
This is pointless. Believe me, there's nothing you can do. If my friend is correct, and Major Kira is being held by the Obsidian Order, retrieving her would be quite impossible.
I'm afraid you overestimate my abilities.
Fine. I'll go along on your little fool's errand. But I want one thing to be perfectly clear... I have no intention of sacrificing my life to save yours. If it looks like we're in danger of being captured... if there are any signs of trouble at all... you're on your own.
How perceptive of you, Commander.
I was merely taking a stroll to stretch my legs. The quarters on this vessel are rather... claustrophobic.
Very observant of you.
This is an Alpha Red priority mission, clearance verification Nine Two One Eight Black. By the authority of the Central Command, you are ordered to turn your ships around. Erase all record of this encounter from your logs and speak of it to no one. Is that clear?
Just something I overheard while hemming someone's pants. I suggest we get away from here as soon as possible.
Treason, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.
Computer, access code Garak one-three-five-nine.
Ironic isn't it? That the only place in the galaxy that still recognizes my access code is a Bajoran space station.
I'd like nothing better than to help my loyal customers, but it's not that simple. My access code allows me to move around the station... unfortunately, as you've just seen, the forcefields reappear as soon as I pass through a doorway.
But for some reason that I can't begin to fathom, Gul Dukat chose not to trust me with his top level security codes during the occupation.
What a creative idea. Tell me, do you eat breakfast, Lieutenant? My lunch calendar is full, but I am looking for someone to join me at breakfast. I'm sure the Doctor will tell you it's the most important meal of the day.
Doctor, what exactly is it about this situation that's making you smile?
I wouldn't even venture a guess. But that reminds me... those pants you wanted altered are ready to be picked up.
You've always been shortsighted... it's held you back over the years.As I recall, your father had the same flaw.
Funny... at his trial, your father said his biggest flaw was that his ambition outweighed his patriotism.
Your own computer program turned against you. I always said your shortsightedness would be your downfall.
Thank you, Doctor, but I'm quite full.
The truth is, I've been trying to lose a little weight. Hemming women's dresses may provide me with a modest income, but it doesn't offer much in the way of exercise.
I wasn't aware that humans saw growing old as a negative experience. On Cardassia, advanced age is seen as a sign of power and dignity.
By all means, Doctor, be as grumpy as you want.
Don't take it personally. He's turning thirty.
What are you doing here, Doctor?
I was looking for Constable Odo. Everyone on this station seems to have disappeared.
Doctor, I admire your tenacity, but I'm afraid it's over. Look at yourself. Your bones are as brittle as twigs, you can barely catch your breath, and you can't even stand, let alone walk.
It would be a privilege. Now what would you like me to do?
"And many more." Doctor, I really must congratulate you. You have a fascinating mind.
You should try to enjoy yourself. It's your birthday.
Sorry, my dear.
I'd be more than willing to help, if I thought it would accomplish anything, but you're only delaying the inevitable.
It sounds like I am a lot more dangerous in your mind than I am in the real world.
Cardassians don't believe in luck, Doctor. You survived because you were strong.
You know, Doctor, the thing I find most fascinating about this entire incident is how your unconscious mind chose people you know to represent the various parts of your personality. What I find interesting is how your mind ended up casting me in the role of the villain.
To think, after all this time, all our lunches together... you still don't trust me. There's hope for you yet, Doctor.
Doctor, I just don't see the value in this man's work. I knew Brutus was going to kill Caesar in the first act, but Caesar doesn't figure it out until the knife is in his back... Tragedy is not the word I would use, farce would be more appropriate. Supposedly, this man is the leader of an entire empire, a brilliant military tactician, yet he can't see what's going on under his very nose...
You're lucky. I have more time on my hands than I know what to do with.
This isn't the first time I've seen you rush through a meal. You never take the time to savor your food. It seems to be a human characteristic.
It's a very interesting sociological trait, don't you think? For generations now, humankind has had more than enough food... yet you all eat as if you were afraid someone was going to come along and take your plate away. Fear of starvation amid plenty... it points to some dark secret hidden in the human soul... a gnawing hunger. Someone should do a study.
If you want to have dessert, go ahead. I won't be offended.
I'm afraid your pants won't be ready tomorrow.
Who would want to kill me... a simple tailor?
The Obsidian Order? Constable, you shouldn't put so much stock in Doctor Bashir's flights of fancy. Are you sure the explosion wasn't an accident, because I can't think of anyone who would wish me harm...
Well... let me see... there was that Nausicaan whose wedding suit I misplaced... and that Yridian I owe money to... and, of course, there's always Major Kira... I'm being serious. I don't think she likes me.
I seriously doubt the Finance Ministry would try to have me killed for failing to pay my taxes.
Do you think I'd lie about a thing like that? It's not something I'm proud of.
Why is it that no one ever believes me, even when I'm telling the truth... ?
Clever lad... a charming story.
You wanted to see me?
You seem to be under the impression that I would knowingly withhold information when my life is at stake. I can assure you, Constable, I have a well developed instinct for self-preservation. If I had anything to add, I would have done so by now.
I'm quite serious. Believe me, having someone try to kill you is no laughing matter.
Trust me, Constable. I can be a most pleasant traveling companion. And this promises to be a very interesting trip.
The truth is usually just an excuse for a lack of imagination.
If you go into my quarters and examine the bulkhead next to the replicator, you'll notice there's a false panel. Behind that panel is a compartment containing an isolinear rod. If I don't return within seventy-eight hours... I want you to take that rod and eat it.
Is it so hard to believe that there's one person in the galaxy who regards me with a certain affection?
I can see how it would be puzzling.
A very interesting analysis... very interesting. Particularly coming from you.
It's been my observation that you act solely out of a sense of justice... or at least what you consider justice. There's no feeling behind what you do, no emotion beyond a distaste for loose ends and disorder. You don't know what it means to care about someone, do you? People are just interesting creatures to you... to be studied and analyzed.
Just that I find it interesting that you'd ascribe feelings and motivations to me that you personally know nothing about. Or am I wrong? Tell me, is there one person in this universe that you care about? One person that is more to you than just an interesting puzzle to be solved. Is there, Odo... anyone?
You always did have a keen sense of fashion. But it seems you've let it go... along with your once-trim figure.
You'll forgive me if I reduce the scope of this conversation to something a little more personal. Why was it necessary to kill me, and the rest of our former associates, before embarking on this... excursion into the Gamma Quadrant?
I never betrayed you! At least... not in my heart.
I learned from the best.
I was good, wasn't I?
Very clever.
I have to admit, this is certainly better than a prison cell.
Why Constable, you seem positively disappointed in me.
Well, I suppose it's understandable. After all, I did pledge my undying devotion and eternal allegiance to both you and the Federation. And you and I've been through so much together... shared so many experiences... I know you considered me a close friend. No wonder you feel betrayed.
I don't need to justify anything to you.
You are imaginative, Constable, I'll grant you that. But I suggest you put those creative powers to better use.
We would be most grateful for any information you could provide.
Really Odo, you must stop reading those human crime novels that Chief O'Brien gives you. It's poisoning your thinking. I'm not here to threaten you, I just want to talk.
This has nothing to do with my "friends" or my "feelings." I simply don't believe he has the information you want.
I have a few questions I'd like to ask you. I had hoped that a few hours alone might jog your memory... but I can see that I'm going to have to take steps I had hoped to avoid.
You do have a certain... flair for sarcasm. It's one of the things I like about you.
Because you and I are a lot alike. We both value our privacy... our inner secrets... that's why I know there's something you haven't told anyone. But you are going to tell me. Maybe something will come to you. I can wait. The question is, can you?
Odo... just tell me what I want to know, and this will end.
That's right. And you have information that I need... information that it's my duty to extract from you. It's not personal.
You can be very persuasive on occasion. But you might consider using... gentler language in the future.
I hope that you'll accept my sincere apologies for all this. I consider the entire conversation as... something best forgotten.
Very thoughtful.
Why do you think something's bothering me?
Maybe I'm just hungry today.
Frankly I don't like what I've been hearing. Rumors of uprisings, civil disturbances. All very alarming.
You'd be surprised at the kind of things you can learn while you're doing alterations.
Let me guess, you're either lost or you're desperately searching for a good tailor.
Maybe they decided they just didn't like me?
You're right, as always, Doctor. They must've mistaken me for someone else.
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
Having trouble keeping the civilians in line?
I'm afraid after the fall of the Obsidian Order, Cardassian security isn't what it used to be.
We can sit here all day reminding ourselves of how much we hate each other. But you don't have the time.
That's uncharacteristically generous of you.
Doctor, I've only just arrived.
Privacy, Doctor? I'd say it goes far deeper than that. Ever since you received this new program, you've been spending virtually all of your free time in the holosuite. But you haven't told anyone what the program is.
You're, forgive me, a talkative man and it's unusual for you to have secrets.
Is this fantasy of yours really that revealing of your inner psyche?
If you have nothing to hide, then why not let me stay.
Don't worry, Doctor. I can be quite discreet. You'll barely know I'm here.
If I may make one observation, I just wanted to point out that your lovely companion is leaving. Odd. She seemed so interested in your advances only a moment ago. I wonder what scared her off? Oh, no. I do apologize. You must be incensed. In fact, if I were in your shoes, I would... grab a bottle of champagne and shoot me.
Come on, Doctor we're going to have a wonderful time... after all, what could possibly go wrong?
A spy? And you live here? I think I joined the wrong intelligence service...
Isn't this a somewhat... ostentatious life for a spy?
Doctor, we're in the middle of an emergency. Is this really the time to be playing games?
Interesting.
I want you to stop treating this like a game where everything's going to turn out all right in the end. Real spies have to make hard choices. You want to save someone? Fine. But you may not have the luxury of saving everyone. Eventually you may have to let someone die.
Another decorator's nightmare. This era has a distinct lack of taste.
Doctor, I don't know if I've made this explicit to you or not... but I really don't want to die chained to a twentieth century laser.
I must say... this is more than I ever wanted to know about your fantasy life, Doctor.
I'd give the two of you some privacy if I could.
Kiss the girl, get the key. They never taught me that in the Obsidian order.
This has gone far enough. It's time to cut our losses.
Yes, they might be killed, and that is unfortunate. But there comes a point when the odds are against you and the only reasonable course of action... is to quit.
As a matter of fact, that's why I've stayed alive and so many of my colleagues are dead. Because I know when to walk away. And that time is now, Doctor. You would know that if you were a real intelligence agent.
That's something else you haven't learned, Doctor. A real intelligence agent has no ego, no conscience, no remorse. Only his sense of professionalism. And mine is telling me it's time to go.
I'm afraid I don't believe you'll pull that trigger.
It's time to face reality, Doctor. You're a man who dreams about being a hero... because deep down, you know that you're not.
I'm no hero either, but I know how to make choices... and I'm choosing to save myself.
That was awfully close, Doctor. What if you'd killed me? Doctor... I believe there's hope for you yet.
Who am I to question Julian Bashir, secret agent? Lead the way.
Interesting. You saved the day by destroying the world.
It seems there's a great deal they didn't teach me. Like the value of a good game of chance... or how indulging in fantasy can keep one's mind... creative.
I thought the whole point was to watch.
I simply thought it would be polite to say hello. But clearly, you think I'm incapable of conducting any kind of pleasant discourse without some nefarious ulterior motive...
You should've been paying attention.
You're not going to hurt me are you?
Normally I would simply make a strategic withdrawal at the first sign of trouble, but there doesn't seem to be any way out of here.
I'm gratified to hear it.
And you, my dear, have nothing to fear from me.
How kind.
Is there... something I can do for you?
I'd be delighted.
I look forward to it.
Such as?
Oh, make them look good... and all this time I thought you wanted me to make them look bad. I wish you'd said that before. It's so much simpler when the customer explains what he wants.
Paranoid is what they call people who imagine threats against their life. I have threats against my life.
Not just yet. I have a question I'd like answered first... why am I here?
So... what shall we talk about first?
Try on the trousers first. I've added extra padding to the seat. You should find swiveling on a barstool much more comfortable.
I'm afraid your pants won't be ready 'til next week.
Oh? Then what can I do for you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're right. I used to be a gardener. Now, if you have something you want weeded, you let me know.
You want me to kill you? Well, that's different...
We're running out of options You don't want to be vaporized because you need a body... the disruptor ruined your clothes... a knife was too savage... the nerve gas smelled bad... hanging took too long, and poison... what was wrong with poison?
For a man who wants to kill himself, you seem strangely determined to live.
You have my word... you'll never know what hit you.
Personally I think Starfleet should allow their officers more latitude in accessorizing their uniforms. You'd be surprised what a nice scarf can do.
How good of you to see me.
Besides, if you do take me along, I think you'll find me quite useful. I'm a man of many talents.
But where you offer kindness, I offer mystery. Where you offer sympathy, I offer intrigue.
I promise you, I will conjure up enough innuendos, half-truths, and bald-faced lies about my "career" in the Obsidian Order to keep the Constable distracted for days.
If there's one thing Cardassians excel at, it's conversation.
Ah, yes. The Assassination of Proconsul Merrok of Romulus. Such a tragedy. I met him once, a few weeks before he died. I was working as a gardener at the Cardassian embassy. My specialty was Edosian Orchids. Beautiful yet highly toxic. So many Romulan dignitaries died unexpectedly that year.
Excuse me, Madam, may I have a moment of your time?
You mean, they're all dead? It's been a pleasure meeting you.
I was hoping to gain control of the phasers as well. I just hadn't gotten around to it yet. Don't you see? We have an opportunity here. A chance to end the Dominion threat once and for all. We have enough firepower on this ship to turn that planet into a smoking cinder. Personally, I think that would be a very good thing.
They'll die. And once the Jem'Hadar ships realize what we're doing, so will we. But what are our lives compared to saving the entire Alpha Quadrant.
I'm not talking about war. What I'm proposing is wiping out every Founder on that planet. Obliterating the Great Link. Come now, Mister Worf, you're a Klingon. Don't tell me you'd object to a little genocide in the name of self-defense.
What you are is a great disappointment.
How does it feel? Comfortable? Not too tight? Itchy? That's the Inkarian Wool. You'll get used to it. Unless of course you're allergic to Inkarian Wool.
Six months in a holding cell. The thought is... unattractive, to say the least.
If I had known what I was walking into, I never would've gone. I thought the Bajorans would be grateful to hear someone provide them with an opposing philosophical view. My understanding was that this conference was supposed to be an examination of the occupation from a dispassionate historical perspective. But instead, everyone went out of their way to dismiss virtually everything I had to say.
Giving me a name tag that said, "Elim Garak, Former Cardassian Oppressor" was hardly polite.
What I would've liked was less posturing and more debate. It's clear to me now that the Bajorans aren't really interested in discovering historical truth so much as they are in promoting the myths and legends of the glorious Resistance.
I took the liberty of borrowing this from the gentlemen who thought my nose needed adjustment.
It's just a hobby.
If my nose didn't hurt so much, I'd entertain you with a fascinating story of how I came to possess it.
I had no idea we were such messy conquerors. I remember the occupation as being a little more tidy than this.
The Bajorans were more suited to this sort of thing than we were. Servile work is in their nature.
There are exceptions to every rule.
The Bajorans never did have a sense of style. Turn the vase upside down, and the Resistance appears.
Not under my nose, Captain... under his.
Look at him. The Commander of Terok Nor. Just another swaggering, self-important Gul with too much vanity and not enough ability.
Does it matter?
You'd think they'd put us in our own cell block, instead of with the common criminals. After all, we're accused of attempting to assassinate the station commander. That deserves some respect.
That's a lie.
I'm afraid I disappointed them. I think they were hoping that message they picked up would contain the key to defeating the Dominion. You should've seen the looks on their faces when I told them it was a five-year old planetary survey report.
There comes a time when you have to face reality, my dear. Those people are gone and they're never coming back. Well, my young friends, I could sit here and chat all day, but I have dresses to make, pants to mend... It's a full life, if a trifle... banal.
Tell Captain Sisko I'd be happy to decode any Cardassian laundry lists that come across his desk.
My dear.
Doctor, I really must remember to stop underestimating you. How did you know?
Very good, doctor. You've come a long way from the naive young man I met five years ago. You've become distrustful and suspicious. It suits you.
Your concern is touching, Doctor. But I assure you, I can take care of myself.
Doctor, I think you've just volunteered.
Oh, I'm sure you could find someone else to eat your meals with. Not that you'll have to. I fully intend to return.
My dear, you're young, so I realize you're a poor judge of character.
Because I'm exiled, alone and a long way from home.
I'd write the actual letter. All you'd have to do is sign it.
Why? Because I'm a Cardassian? You're a Klingon... Nog is a Ferengi. Starfleet Academy is a very accepting place.
I know I've done some unfortunate things in the past. And I regret them. That's why I want to join Starfleet. Why I need to join Starfleet. I'm looking for a fresh start... a way to make up for all the damage I've done. To prove to myself that I can be better than I am. But I need your help... your support to start me on my way... to redemption.
Personally, I think I could be quite an asset to Starfleet. With my extensive experience I should be able to skip the lower ranks entirely and begin my career as a Commander. Maybe you should suggest that in your letter... tell them you'd be honored to serve under me.
Lying is a skill like any other. If you want to maintain a level of excellence, you have to practice constantly.
I don't see why these runabout replicators can't provide a more varied menu. I would like to get my hands on this fellow Earl Grey and tell him a thing or two about tea leaves.
Believe me, I have no desire to take an "unnecessary risk."
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.
Are we glad to see you. Can one of you point us in the direction of the wormhole?
Ah, good. You look like the man in charge. I was just trying to explain to your colleagues here that this is all an unfortunate misunderstanding.
Aren't you Klingons supposed to kill yourselves when you're taken prisoner?
That's it? After I've come all this way? After all I've been through? That's all you have to say to me?
I want you to say "Thank you, Elim. Your loyalty is most gratifying. I knew I could count on you."
I never should've come here. I should've let that monster die alone and forgotten.
My whole life, I've done nothing but try to please that man. I let him mold me, turn me into a mirror image of himself. And how did he repay me? With exile. But I forgave him. And now, here at the end, I thought maybe, just maybe, he could forgive me. I was a fool. Let this be a lesson to you, doctor... perhaps the most valuable I can teach you... Sentiment is the greatest weakness of all.
Father, you're dying. For once in your life, speak the truth.
So you've told me. Many times. Enabran, listen to me. All I ask is that for this moment, let me be your son.
Gentlemen, I don't know about you... but my business here is done.
It's nice to feel needed.
Excuse me?
Perhaps there's been some sort of misunderstanding. The last time I checked, I was a Cardassian.
I only wish I were still in the Obsidian Order. This would make a wonderful interrogation chamber. Tight quarters, no air, bad lighting, random electric shocks. It's perfect.
That... was thoroughly unpleasant.
I'm sorry. That's absolutely unacceptable. I'm under enough strain as it is, I can't have you quitting on me.
Get a hold of yourself, Garak. After all, you haven't had one of these attacks in years. Yes, this is a tight enclosed space. Yes, there's not a lot of room to move. But a disciplined mind doesn't allow itself to be sidetracked by niggling psychological disorders like claustrophobia. Besides, this isn't like Tzenketh. These walls won't collapse around you. There's plenty of air. And you have friends close by. You have nothing to be concerned about.
Focus on the job. You're the only one who can contact the runabout. People are depending on you. Ziyal is depending on you. You promised her you'd come back. And that young lady has had quite enough disappointments in her life without you adding to them. So 	control yourself. You're stronger than this. A disciplined mind...
Our original plan will work. I just have to finish what I started. After all, a verse about how the Cardassian panicked in the face of danger would ruin General Martok's song.
Now, if you'll excuse me...	 My dungeon awaits.
Doctor, would you please keep the noise down. I'm trying to work in here.
How do you know I didn't volunteer?
Nothing so coarse. The captain bribed me. He offered to help me procure a larger space for my workshop. The latest dressmaking equipment is surprisingly bulky.
It's just that lately, I've noticed that everyone seems to... trust me. It's quite unnerving. I'm still trying to get used to it. Next thing I know, people will be inviting me to their homes for dinner.
This is maddening. Asking a Ferengi to play a Cardassian game is like asking a Klingon to chew with his mouth closed.
I'm just curious, why do you and Doctor Bashir spend hours in the holosuites dressed up as fighter pilots, reliving ancient battles?
Interesting...
That's the trouble with humans... you don't know how to appreciate a good mystery.
I'm flattered. But I'm afraid I have other plans.
I don't intend to stand around waiting to be killed.
You're fighting your instincts, I can see it.
Access denied. Access denied. Don't you know how to say anything else? Apparently not... How monotonous.
"Secure" is such a relative term, wouldn't you agree?
I'd love to stay and hypothesize with you all afternoon... but once I set my mind to a task, I hate to leave it unfinished.
I'm not a tailor. Not for the moment anyway.
I know you're hiding somewhere... Ah, there you are.
I haven't had this much fun in years. My heart's pounding... The blood is racing through myveins... I feel so alive. And I bet you do, too.
Admit it, you're a killer. We both are. Behind your Federation mask of decency and benevolence, you're a predator, just like me.
He has nothing to worry about. I'm not going to shoot an unarmed man. What fun would that be?
Naughty, naughty.
I admit I'm tempted to finish this right now... But I'd be depriving myself of too much enjoyment.
I'm disappointed, Chief. I was hoping to see bloodlust in your eyes, but all I see is fear.
My dear, I find your blind adoration both flattering and disturbing.
I don't think I'd be very welcome on Bajor.
Let me tell you a story. I once knew a Cardassian, a dashing, handsome young man with a promising career. And then one day, through no fault of his own, he found himself exiled and alone, with nowhere to turn. But did he give up? No. Instead he struck upon a brilliant plan. Rather than fleeing for the rest of his life, he sought shelter in the one place no one expected him to go. In a stronghold of his people's most hated enemies. There, surrounded by hostile strangers, he built a life. And there, against all odds, against the merciless logic of the Universe itself, he thrived.
The moral, my dear, is to never underestimate my gift for survival.
I must say, Constable, I admire your composure. You're an island of tranquility in a sea of chaos.
I'm not feeling too useful myself, at the moment. If it'd make you feel any better, you could always deputize me.
It's ironic. When the Klingons attacked this station, Gul Dukat and I fought side-by-side. At one point, when he was struggling with a Klingon, he turned his back to me, and I have to admit, for a moment, he made a very tempting target.
Shoot a man in the back, that's the safest way, isn't it? But then I thought, "I can't fight all these Klingons by myself." So I let him live.
My dear Constable, before this day is over, everyone on this station is going to regret it.
I'd like to come along, if you don't mind. You never know when you might need a good tailor. And the simple fact is, I have nowhere else to go.
Ah, there you are. I'd just about given up hope, doctor. I would think that all those lunches we've shared would've entitled me to preferential treatment.
If you're trying to cheer me up, it's working. I feel better already.
I was studying some star charts for Captain Sisko during the last assault when I had a sudden and somewhat violent encounter with a bulkhead.
I wish I shared your confidence. Oh, I'm sure my head will heal, but the way this war is going... I wouldn't bet on any of us living to a ripe, old age.
Let me guess, you've used that genetically enhanced brain of yours to calculate our chances of survival.
I'm really not interested, Doctor. Ever since it became public knowledge that you were genetically engineered, you've used every opportunity to show off.
Look at you. You act like you haven't a care in the world. It's that kind of smug, superior attitude that makes people like you so unpopular.
A thirty-two point seven percent chance of survival... I call that insulting.
Don't tell me, tell them.
The question is, do we know what we're doing?
Lucky for you, it ripped on the seam. Unlucky for you, my sewing kit went down with the ship.
You're deliberately trying to stay behind me and I want to know why. Does this have something to do with that unfortunate business between you and me last year? 
Cadet... there may be hope for you yet.
Shut up. As I tried to explain to your men, my name is Kamar and I am a member of the Cardassian Intelligence Bureau, what used to be known as the Obsidian Order. A week ago, while performing my duties in the glorious service of the Founders, I was captured by the USS Centaur. I was being held aboard one of their shuttles when we were forced to hide in this dark matter nebula by the unexpected appearance of a Dominion battleship.
Slow down, Nog. We don't want to startle anyone.
Correction, humans have rules in war. Rules that tend to make victory a little harder to achieve, in my opinion.
Keep looking, Doctor. I'm sure whatever Starfleet put in there is very well hidden.
You don't know them as well as I do. They're desperate people. I would've if I were them. In fact, when I was conducting interrogations for the Obsidian Order, I did a lot worse.
Well take it from me, it's a lot more fun asking questions than answering them.
I always hope for the best. Unfortunately, experience has taught me to expect the worst.
What an education you're getting.
I must say I'm flattered, Captain. I had no idea you held such a lofty opinion of me. Your faith in my ability to retrieve classified information from my former homeland is most gratifying.
You know, I had assumed this meeting was about the modifications I suggested for your new dress uniform. you have had an opportunity to look over my design, haven't you?
No one wants to see the Dominion destroyed more than I do. But asking me to go to Cardassia Prime, penetrate one of the most heavily guarded facilities in the quadrant, steal top secret war plans and then return them safely to you is not just another "job." It's more like a suicide mission and that is well outside my field of expertise.
To do what you're asking would use up every resource I have left on Cardassia. And it may be a very messy, very bloody business. Are you prepared for that?
I share your desire for swift action, captain. In fact, after our last conversation, I made a few discreet inquiries among my former associates still living on Cardassia. As I anticipated, they shared my loathing for the current government and were more than 	willing to take on an assignment aimed at its destruction. Unfortunately, they're all dead now. All killed within one day of speaking with me. I suppose that's a testament to the effectiveness of Dominion security. One should admire such... efficiency.
I hope you're not giving up that easily. After all, the stakes are much higher than a few dead operatives. The fate of the entire quadrant hangs in the balance, or at least that's the case you made to me.
As a matter of fact, I do have another plan. But I suspect that you won't like it. I suggest we manufacture that evidence ourselves.
There are some things I'd rather not discuss.
Mind if I join you?
I've locked him in his quarters. I've also left him with the distinct impression that if he attempts to force open the door, it may... explode.
It's best not to dwell on such minutiae. In any case, we have far more important matters to discuss.
Why don't you wait in your quarters. I'll be along shortly to... say hello.
Felt good, didn't it? To put your hands on a man and say, "You will do this or else." After all the intrigue and deception you've had to engage in over the past week, you must've found that moment of pure brute force to be a... refreshing change of pace.
Think of them as tragic victims of war.
Oh, but I think there is. You see, when the Tal Shiar finishes examining the wreckage of Vreenak's shuttle, they'll find the burnt remnants of a Cardassian optolythic data-rod which miraculously survived the explosion. After painstaking forensic examination, they'll discover that the rod contains a recording of a high-level Dominion meeting at which the invasion of Romulus was being planned. Any imperfections in the forgery will appear to be a result of the explosion. So, with a seemingly legitimate data-rod in one hand and a dead senator in the other, I ask you captain, what conclusion would you draw?
That is why you came to me, isn't it, captain? Because you knew I could do the things you weren't capable of doing yourself? Well, it worked. And you'll get what you wanted, a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. If your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant. And all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal, and the self-respect of one Starfleet Officer. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.
To lose such sacred ground would be devastating to Cardassians everywhere. And a great propaganda victory for you.
This is a momentous occasion. It's not every day I embark on a journey to liberate my homeworld.
I'm afraid you're going to have to get them from somewhere else. My shop's closed. Starfleet Intelligence is keeping me quite busy these days.
I don't have the time. Do you have any idea how long it takes to decode a Cardassian military transmission? I invented some of the basic encryption protocols when I was with the Obsidian Order, and it still takes me days to decipher a simple sentence.
I don't like people looming over me. I have to get back to work. Thank you for your company, gentlemen.
Believe me, captain, I'm not happy about it either. I want to see this war end as much as you do.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hem some pants. For some reason, sewing seems to calm me down.
That depends on what's involved. You see, I'm a very private person.
My father used to lock me in when I misbehaved. I wasn't trapped. I knew he'd let me out when I learned my lesson.
I could be very stubborn.
Are you saying that if I can stop blaming myself, my claustrophobia will just disappear? Well, I'll certainly give your advice some thought.
If you don't mind, I'd like to sit here and be alone for a while.
Oh, no. Don't start. Spare me your insipid psychobabble. I'm not some quivering neurotic who feels sorry for himself because his daddy wasn't nice to him. You couldn't begin to understand me.
Well, I'm not interested in dissecting my childhood... all I want is to free my people from the Dominion. I don't need someone to come in here and hold my hand, I need someone who can	help me get back to work. And you, my dear, aren't up to the task.
Get out of here. Before I say something unkind.
I didn't think you'd darken my doorstep again.
How nice for you.
That's very gratifying...
Don't you see? I wanted to believe I was helping my people, liberating them, but all I've done is pave the way for their annihilation. I'm a traitor!
Well... I'm breathing a lot better than I was.
When I first agreed to help Starfleet, I was convinced that it was the right thing to do. I didn't allow myself to doubt it, even for a moment. I never realized how much it was gnawing away at me. I suppose I was looking for a way out... and the claustrophobia gave me an excuse to stop fighting against my people.
Ah, Romulus. How well I remember it. You will find the predominant color to be gray. The buildings. The clothes. The people. Did you know that the Romulan heart itself is gray? It's true. And entirely appropriate for such an unimaginative race.
How dull.
How sad. I must tell you it's a bit disappointing to hear you mouthing the usual platitudes about peace and friendship regarding an implacable foe like the Romulans. But, I live in hope that someday you'll see the universe as it truly is, rather than as you wish it to be.
They'll tolerate you. To a point. But if I were you, I'd watch my back. See you in the morning.
How nice. And now that the formalities are out of the way, let's try to remember that our enemy is the Dominion, and not each other.
You don't know how lucky you are.
My approach may have been quiet, but I assure you, I had no intention of "sneaking" up on you. My apologies.
You appeared to have things under control.
How little you understand me.
Cardassia. It's as beautiful as I remembered.
Ah, the glamor of being a revolutionary...
I don't know why you're making such a fuss over this. I have a very busy repair schedule and I can't stand here all night arguing with you.
Have we done something wrong? We're new to the city and I'm afraid we've gotten lost.
This isn't the first time my cousin has been mistaken for that traitor.
I hope you don't consider me ungrateful, but what are you doing here?
You're too kind.
I haven't changed much, have I?
How ironic that Cardassia's saviour should be a former Bajoran terrorist.
Of course I don't look well, I've been living in a cellar.
Does anyone have any final words?
How disappointing.
During all my years of exile... I imagined what it would be like to come home... maybe even to live in this house again with Mila. But now she's dead and this house is about to become a pile of rubble... My Cardassia is gone.
We have a problem. I'm afraid it's a rather large one.
Isn't it obvious? Here we are, ready to storm the castle... willing to sacrifice our lives in a noble effort to slay the Dominion beast in its lair and we can't even get inside the gate.
For Cardassia.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Some may say that we've gotten exactly what we deserve... after all, we're not exactly "innocent," are we? And I'm not just talking about the Bajoran occupation... our entire history is one of arrogant aggression. We collaborated with the Dominion... betrayed the Alpha Quadrant... there's no doubt about it, we're guilty as charged.
Doctor, please, spare me your insufferable Federation optimism. Of course it will survive... but not the Cardassia I knew. We had a rich and ancient culture, our literature, music, art were second to none. And now, so much of it is lost... So many of our best people... our most gifted minds...
Quite all right, doctor. You've been a good friend. I'm going to miss our lunches together.
I'd like to think we'll see each other again. But who can say... we live in uncertain times.
