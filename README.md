# Plain Simple Garak - A Quote Generator

Plain Simple Garak is a BiGRU text generation model that the goal is generating texts similar to [Garak](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Elim_Garak, "Memory Alpha")'s quotes.   
The model contains two seperate GRU layers and a shared Embedding layer. For each input, the model randomly selects which layer should be used - meaning that the text generated will be always different for the same input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6.9+
- Pytorch 1.7.0+
- CUDA 10.1+
- nltk 3.0+
- Pandas 1.0+

To install requirements:

```setup
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

PlainSimpleGarak.ipynb should be used for training at the moment - will be changed soon.

## Text Generation

For now, use PlainSimpleGarak_GenerateText.ipynb. seperate .py script file will be uploaded soon.
