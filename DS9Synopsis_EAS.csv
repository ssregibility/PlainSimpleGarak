"Emissary
","S01E01-02
","Three years after losing his wife Jennifer in the Battle of Wolf 359, Commander Benjamin Sisko is assigned as the new commander of a plundered space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. Having liberated themselves from sixty years of Cardassian rule, the newly established Bajoran provisional government is seeking Federation assistance for the task of rebuilding their pillaged planet. The discovery of the first stable wormhole into the Gamma Quadrant adds a strategic significance to the station, and when it is moved to the ""mouth"" of the wormhole, it becomes an attractive target for the Cardassians to recapture. The wormhole itself is inhabited by a non-corporeal species that have a religious significance to the Bajoran people to whom they refer as the ""Prophets"". It was prophesied that their ""Celestial Temple"" (the wormhole) would be found by an emissary, who in this case is none other than Commander Sisko himself."

","S07E25-26
","Julian and Ezri wake up together on a day that should change everything. The uprising on Cardassia is the signal for the alliance to begin their final assault on the Dominion. The Cardassian people, however, pay a high price when the Jem'Hadar destroy the Lakarian City with its two million inhabitants. During the battle with the Federation alliance, the Cardassian ships, whose crews have just been notified of the massacre begin to fire on their former allies, the Breen and the Jem'Hadar. The female Founder now summons their ships and troops to Cardassia and she orders to slaughter all Cardassians. Damar, Kira and Garak are captured and are facing their execution, but they are saved by fellow Cardassian patriots. When the group storms the Dominion headquarters, Damar is fatally wounded. Garak kills Weyoun 8 and is pleased to hear that it was the last of his kind. The female Founder is taken prisoner. In the meantime, the Federation fleet has reached Cardassia and is preparing for the ultimate battle against what is left of the Dominion. Odo, however, beams down to Cardassia and links with the female Founder, thereby healing her. She agrees to a capitulation of the Dominion forces who retreat to the Gamma Quadrant. Odo decides to return to the Great Link to cure his people, which Kira sadly accepts. Worf becomes the Federation Ambassador to Qo'noS. O'Brien is about to leave to teach engineering at Starfleet Academy. In the Bajoran Fire Caves, the Pah-wraiths restore Dukat's Cardassian appearance. Sisko enters the scene. With the power of the Kosst Amojan Dukat kills Kai Winn. In a last effort to save Bajor, Sisko grabs Dukat, and they fall into the fire. The Kosst Amojan burn, thereby ensuring that the Pah-wraiths and Dukat have to stay in the caves forever. Sisko finds himself among the Prophets, who tell him that his mission is now finished and he needs rest. He has to stay with the Prophets. On the station, Kira and Jake are standing behind a promenade deck window, looking out at the vastness of space..."
"The Ascent
","S05E09
","Quark and Odo are on their way to a hearing, when Quark notices a whistling sound in the floor of the runabout. It is a bomb, obviously planted by the Orion Syndicate. They manage to contain the explosion in a transporter beam. Still, the small vessel crash lands on a desolate and cold Class-L planetoid. Quark suggests that they carry the emergency emitter to the top of a high mountain in order to increase its range. The two are already completely exhausted when they discover that the mountain is still days away. Moreover, Odo breaks his leg when the two slide down into a valley. Odo insists that Quark leave him behind. He is prepared to die when the Defiant arrives and beams him up."
"Past Prologue
","S01E03
","The Bajoran Tahna Los is beamed into DS9 after narrowly evading a pursuing Cardassian warship. Tahna belongs to the Khon-ma, a particularly ruthless terrorist group, and now seeks political asylum. Major Kira, who knows Tahna from her time in the resistance, supports the request in any way possible, acting against Commander Sisko. In the interim the two renegade Klingon sisters from the House of Duras, Lursa and B'Etor, have arrived on the station and meet with Tahna. He tries to enlist Kira's assistance to obtain a runabout but does not reveal his motive. His yet unknown goal is to detonate a bilitrium explosive, which he plans to purchase from the Duras sisters, to seal the entrance to the wormhole, and therefore eliminate the need for a Federation presence on Bajor. But the Duras sisters plan to double-cross Tahna and to deliver him to the Cardassians for a price. Sisko reluctantly allows Kira to accompany Tahna to the rendezvous with the Klingon sisters in the hope of revealing his intended target. Although Tahna manages to briefly elude Sisko and O'Brien, his plan is thwarted when Kira seizes control of the runabout, enters the wormhole, and detonates the device in the Gamma Quadrant."
"A Man Alone
","S01E04
","Odo is enraged when he meets Ibudan, a Bajoran who was convicted of murdering a Cardassian but was released from prison by the new Bajoran government. When Ibudan is murdered in a holosuite, Odo is the main suspect because evidently no other humanoid entered the holosuite. As a restless mob of the station's denizens gather to confront Odo, Bashir makes the startling discovery that the murder victim is in fact a clone, created and subsequently murdered by the real Ibudan in order to implicate Odo. In a final twist of irony, Ibudan is swiftly apprehended by Odo, and is accordingly charged with the murder of his own clone. Meanwhile, after Jake and his new Ferengi friend, Nog, are caught playing pranks on the promenade, Keiko O'Brien decides to open a school on the station."
"Babel
","S01E05
","In the midst of being inundated by a spate of maintenance requests, O'Brien inadvertently triggers a device that releases a virus, causing an advanced form of aphasia in his brain that makes him unable to communicate with anyone. As the virus keeps spreading through the food replicators and then mutates into an airborne strain, the station's officers gradually become incapacitated. Even worse, the virus turns out to be lethal. Bashir still finds out that not the Cardassians but the Bajorans created the virus before he is affected too. Kira travels to Bajor and kidnaps the co-creator of the virus, Surmak Ren, by beaming him into her runabout and infecting him as well. When Captain Jaheel tries to escape from the quarantined station and overloads his ship's engines, Odo and Quark have to work together to remove his ship from the docking ring. Surmak Ren soon manages to develop a cure based on Bashir's research."
"Captive Pursuit
","S01E06
","The station receives its first visitor from the Gamma Quadrant, an unannounced ship carrying a single lifeform, who happened to spot another ship going through the wormhole and followed it. As the visitor's starship is damaged and requires help in repairs, Sisko sends O'Brien to make first contact with the alien, who calls himself Tosk and seems to be nervous about something. When Tosk attempts to break into the station's weapons storage, Odo arrests the alien. Another starship from the Gamma Quadrant arrives and promptly scans the station. The crew of the new ship transport over and attempt to take Tosk forcibly. After a skirmish with station security the leader locates Tosk in his cell. After further negotiations Sisko learns that a ""Tosk"" is a lifeform bread to be hunted by the other aliens, the ""Hunters"". Under the terms of the Prime Directive, he agrees to hand over Tosk to the Hunters, knowing that they would display him in a cage for his failure to escape. O'Brien, however, frees Tosk, so the hunt can continue to everyone's satisfaction."
"Q-Less
","S01E07
","The runabout Ganges returns to the station with hardly any power and its crew and passenger in danger from lack of life support. Jadzia Dax and another crewman have returned with Vash after finding her in the Gamma Quadrant. With her is Q, who has been hounding Vash as a traveling companion for two years. Vash brings several artifacts to the station that she has acquired in the Gamma Quadrant, among them a remarkable crystal. She makes fast friends with Quark and agrees with the Ferengi profiteer to auction them off. Unbeknownst to the crew, however, the crystal draws energy from the station's power systems, leading to a massive build-up of gravitons that pushes the station towards the wormhole. Using ionized tritium, Dax is able to pinpoint the origin of the gravitons, and Sisko has the artifact beamed into space. There an embryonic lifeform frees itself from the crystal and vanishes into the wormhole."
"Dax
","S01E08
","Dr. Bashir attempts in vain to avoid the kidnapping of Jadzia Dax by a group of Klaestrons. Only the station's tractor beam can stop their departing ship. Ilon Tandro claims that Curzon Dax committed treason and was responsible for the killing of his father, General Ardelon Tandro, 30 years ago in the civil war on Klaestron IV. He demands the extradition of Jadzia Dax, which to decide about is up to a Bajoran arbiter, Els Renora. Sisko, however, argues that already the warrant is incorrect because if anyone, the former host Curzon or the symbiont Dax but not Jadzia committed a crime. Meanwhile on Klaestron IV, Odo finds out that Curzon was in bed with General Tandro's wife at the time he is said to have sent transmissions to the enemy, so the charges are dropped."
"The Passenger
","S01E09
","Major Kira and Dr. Bashir are aboard the Rio Grande when they respond to a distress signal sent by a Kobliad ship. They can rescue just the Kobliad security officer, Kajada. Her prisoner, Rao Vantika, grabs Bashir's neck and then dies. Back on the station, Kajada suspects that Vantika is still alive, for he has faked his death more than once. Also, a shipment of deuridium from the Gamma Quadrant is to arrive at the station, a substance essential for the survival of the Kobliad. While a DNA scan confirms that the body is indeed Vantika, Jadzia Dax theorizes that he could have transferred his consciousness to another person by injecting encoded glial cells to this person's body. This person is Dr. Bashir, who is now under the control of Vantika and who has enlisted help from mercenaries to hijack the deuridium freighter. When his plan is being foiled and the ship is secured by the station's tractor beam, Vantika threatens to go to warp, thereby killing Bashir and polluting the system with deuridium. But Jadzia succeeds in modulating the tractor beam with a frequency that would disable Vantika's cells in Bashir's body. After the glial cells have been beamed out, Kajada vaporizes them and thereby everything that is left of Vantika."

But all the visitors are interested in is Quark's games. After a while the Wadi catch the Ferengi cheating. As a penalty, Sisko, Dax, Bashir and Kira are trapped inside a game world controlled by the Wadi, while Quark is watching helplessly, reacting to the game as they go, in an attempt to free the officers. When Quark thinks that the officers are lost because of his fault, the Wadi leader declares that it was all just a game."
"The Nagus

","Grand Nagus Zek, the head of all Ferengi, appears on the station to hold a conference on developing business relations with the Gamma Quadrant. During the meeting with Ferengi delegates the old leader announces his retirement and totally unexpectedly declares that he has chosen Quark as his successor. This causes a great deal of unease among the assembled high-ranking Ferengi. Zek dies the next day as it seems. Soon someone attempts to assassinate the new Nagus Quark with a locator bomb. While Odo is investigating the case, the two assassins, Quark's brother Rom and Zek's son Krax, plan to finish their business and to blow Quark out of an airlock. But Odo and Zek, who feigned his death, thwart the plan. Zek, now knowing that Krax is no worthy successor, decides to exploit the business opportunities in the Gamma Quadrant himself."
"Vortex

","While Quark is negotiating the sale of an alien ""FabergÃ© egg"" with Miradorn twins, a man from the Gamma Quadrant enters the room, attempts to steal the egg and eventually kills one of the twins. Odo, after capturing him, finds out that the alien named Croden is wanted on his homeworld Rakhar for previous crimes, but also discovers the man knows something about Odo's kind, the Changelings. Croden shows him an artifact that can morph into a different shape just like Odo and that may be something like a distant relative. During the transport to Rakhar the Miradorn's twin brother comes after the pair. They enter a nebula, where Croden allegedly found the artifact and even met Changelings in person. But once they have landed on an asteroid, Croden uses the artifact as a key to the stasis chamber in which he kept his daughter safe, the only member of his family who survived the persecution. Odo steers the runabout into a pocket of toh-maire gas, where the Miradorn ship explodes when it fires its weapons. He eventually decides to let Croden and his daughter go."
"Battle Lines
","S01E13
","The station receives an unannounced visit from Kai Opaka, the spiritual leader of Bajor, whom Sisko offered a tour of the station. Knowing that no ship would pass the wormhole on this day for Opaka to watch, he invites the Kai to travel through the wormhole on a runabout, together with him, Kira and Bashir. In the Gamma Quadrant they follow the trace of a subspace signal to a moon with a satellite network, where the runabout is shot down and Opaka dies in the crash. But some time later she is alive again, because of artificially created microbes that have restored her body functions. The moon is a prison, to which the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis were exiled and where they can carry on with their conflict forever, thanks to the microbes. Sisko gathers representatives of the two factions to start peace talks, with the hope of getting all of them off that moon, but it ends in another bloody skirmish. In the meantime Bashir has discovered that the microbes only work in the special environment on the moon, which means that also Opaka has to stay behind. But Opaka has already decided for herself that it is her destiny to stay. After Jadzia and O'Brien have managed to create a gap in the satellite network, just Sisko, Kira and Bashir are beamed up."
"The Storyteller
","S01E14
","The station is hosting a conference on a conflict between the Paqu and the Navot on Bajor that has broken out because the Cardassians redirected a river that was laid down as the border between the two. The leader of the Paqu is Varis Sul, a teenage girl that catches Nog's attention. He and Jake befriend the girl and contribute their share to the solution, which keeps the border as it is but allows the Paqu, who would otherwise be cut off, free access to the river. Meanwhile, Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien have been sent to Bajor for a medical emergency. The two discover that an entity composed of energy periodically attacks the village, and does so while the pair are there. Aiding the dying sirah, a ""storyteller"", O'Brien helps back away the strange phenomenon the locals call ""Dal'Rok"". After saving the village the locals proclaim O'Brien as their new sirah, angering Hovath, the old sirah's apprentice. The Dal'Rok is in reality a manifestation of the village's anger and can be defeated only with unanimity. When O'Brien fails during another attack of the Dal'Rok, the young Hovath, who was always meant to be the successor but lacked the necessary determination so far, successfully takes over the task."
"Progress
","S01E15
","The station is assisting the Bajoran government in an energy transfer, tapping the molten core of Bajor's fifth moon Jeraddo in an attempt to provide energy for the planet. The moon holds some settlers, so Kira and Dax are dispatched with a runabout to make sure the evacuation is complete before the transfer begins. Sensors pick up lifeforms. Kira beams down to find a group of three Bajoran farmers, who refuse to leave their homes. Among them is an older man named Mullibok, who invites Kira for supper. Kira returns without the farmers. When she beams down again to Jeraddo with two security officers, they are being attacked and one of them shoots Mullibok. Kira stays on Jeraddo to care about the injured man. But although she sympathizes with him, Kira eventually decides that there is no way back and destroys his house. On the station, Jake and Nog make a bargain with Cardassian yamok sauce that Quark just wanted to get rid of."
"If Wishes Were Horses
","S01E16
","Various manifestations of the crew's imagination come to life, such as the 21st century baseball player Buck Bokai, the fairy-tale character Rumpelstiltskin, a sensual version of Dax that so far existed only in Bashir's mind and other strange effects. The real Dax attributes the phenomena to a possible subspace rupture forming near the station, of a kind that destroyed a whole solar system in the 23rd century. As such an anomaly is actually discovered and an attempt is made to collapse it, the rupture widens and threatens to destroy the station. But Sisko recognizes that the anomaly is just another product of everyone's imagination. The whole scenario was set up by an alien race in an attempt to understand the concept of imagination."
"The Forsaken
","S01E17
","A group of pompous Federation ambassadors arrive on the station, proceeding with a fact-finding mission concerning the wormhole. Sisko has the foresight to assign Dr. Bashir to escort them about the station while he prefers to tend to business. Among the ambassadors is Lwaxana Troi who develops an interest for Odo. Shortly afterwards a probe comes through the wormhole and after data has been downloaded from there, the station begins to experience strange malfunctions. A turbolift with Odo and Lwaxana Troi gets stuck, and there is no way of getting them out before Odo has to return to his liquid state. Lwaxana, however, assures him that there is nothing to be embarrassed about. O'Brien finally recognizes that the program behaves like a ""puppy"" that wants to be entertained, and so instead of trying to eliminate it he transfers it from the main system to a subroutine he calls a ""doghouse""."
"Dramatis Personae

","Kira suspects that a Valerian freighter scheduled to dock at the station is delivering weapons to Cardassia as they did during the occupation. But Sisko refuses her request to search the ship. The wormhole opens, and a Klingon cruiser returning from the Gamma Quadrant explodes just after exiting. The vessel's first officer is able to beam aboard the station, but dies after cryptically uttering the phrase ""Victory!"". In the following, the officers begin to behave strangely, and they form two factions aboard the station, one in support of Major Kira and one remaining loyal to Captain Sisko. The situation escalates when the opposing camps scheme to eliminate one another. Odo and Bashir manage to remove the cause for the tensions, a telepathic matrix created by the Saltah'nans that made the crew as well as the Klingons re-enact an ancient power struggle."

Kira Nerys has Marritza placed under arrest and delves into his background. After visual evidence from the camp has been unearthed, the man has to admit he is Gul Darhe'el, the notorious commandant of Gallitep. But after Odo's further investigation it turns out that he really is Marritza, who served as a filing clerk in Gallitep. By altering his face and posing as one of the biggest war criminals in Bajoran history he wanted to make the case public and help alleviate Cardassia's and his own guilt. When Marritza is released and about to return to his home planet, a Bajoran appears from the crowd and stabs him - apparently just because Marritza is a Cardassian."

In the meantime O'Brien is investigating the disappearance of his staff member Aquino, only to discover that he has been murdered by someone whom must have caught tampering with a runabout. O'Brien finds evidence that Neela, a Bajoran member of his staff, is the culprit. Vedek Bareil, Winn's rival in the election of the new Bajoran Kai, appears on the station, and Neela's attempt to kill him and escape with a runabout is foiled in the last moment.

Gul Dukat surprisingly apologizes for the existence of the camp and promises that all detainees be released soon. Meanwhile on Deep Space 9, an extremist Bajoran group named ""Alliance for Global Unity"" or simply ""The Circle"" demands that all aliens leave Bajor.

On Bajor, Kira is anesthetized and kidnapped. When she wakes up, Minister Jaro reveals that he is the leader of The Circle. Sisko, Bashir and Li manage to free Kira and take her back to the station, while The Circle in the form of Jaro and Vedek Winn is preparing to seize power on Bajor and to attack the station - unbeknownst of the fact that everything is a Cardassian ploy."

Dukat later reveals that the boy is the son of Pa'Dar, an influential politician on Cardassia. Bashir and Garak take a shuttle to the orphanage on Bajor where any record about Rugal is missing. It turns out that Dukat deliberately separated the boy from his father and erased the evidence in the hopes of humiliating his political opponent.

","An explosion shatters Garak's tailor shop on Deep Space 9. Partially due to Garak's unwillingness to talk, Odo does not find any solid evidence against the main suspect, a Flaxian named Retaya. Upon leaving the station Retaya's ship explodes, apparently because of Romulan sabotage. Odo surmises that Garak himself is responsible for the explosion in his shop to get the security chief involved. When he tells Garak that five Cardassian agents died in unfortunate accidents the same day that the shop was blown up, Garak becomes uneasy that someone might kill his mentor Enabran Tain, the former head of the Obsidian Order, likewise. Odo and Garak take a runabout to investigate Tain's recent disappearance when they are pulled inside a Romulan Warbird. To their surprise they find Tain who has forged an alliance between the Obsidian Order and the Romulan Tal Shiar under Colonel Lovok. A combined fleet of Warbirds and the ships that the Obsidian Order secretly built in the Orias system is going to destroy the Founders' homeworld in the Delta Quadrant. Garak was actually on Tain's assassination list as he could know too much, but now Tain grants him an opportunity to redeem himself - by torturing Odo in order to find out more about the Founders. Sisko is warned by Starfleet of the imminent military operation, and is ordered to stand by to be prepared for retaliatory attacks of the Jem'Hadar. But Sisko takes the Defiant to the Gamma Quadrant, hoping to find Odo on one of the attacking vessels. Commander Eddington, however, disables the cloaking under orders of Starfleet Command. On the Warbird, Garak finally disables the restriction device and allows Odo to return to his fluid state. In orbit of the planet known to be the Founders' homeworld, all 19 Cardassian and Romulan ships open fire and devastate the surface. But the planet has been evacuated, and a fleet of 150 Jem'Hadar vessels ambush the Romulan-Cardassian fleet which is totally destroyed. With the help of Lovok, who is actually a Founder, Garak and Odo manage to escape and are rescued by the Defiant."

Ishka admits that she made a profit of three bars of latinum. But Quark later discovers that it is actually much more, so much that it would ruin him, as he would have to refund it should she refuse.

","Julian Bashir is interrogated by an officer named Sloan of the Internal Affairs department. Sloan questions Bashir's loyalty, and he surmises that the genetically enhanced doctor who was once kidnapped by the Dominion could work as a spy for them without even knowing. Bashir's support for his genetically engineered friends who proposed that the Federation surrender casts even more doubt on Bashir. Then Bashir is kidnapped by Weyoun who claims that he was indeed ""broken"" to work for the Dominion. However, Bashir unmasks everything that happened as a holodeck simulation. The real Sloan of the secret Section 31 was testing the doctor's aptitude as a secret agent. Back on Deep Space 9, Bashir makes clear to Sisko that he would never work for Section 31, but the curious captain advises him to accept if Sloan should return."

Garak suggests to fabricate evidence that the Dominion were planning an attack on Romulus and to present it to the Romulan Senator Vreenak. The senator arrives, and Sisko takes him to a holosuite where they witness a meeting of Weyoun and Damar who discuss plans to invade Romulus. The fraud fails when, upon an examination of the data rod with the recording, Vreenak recognizes that it is faked and takes off with his shuttle.

But Odo can't ignore that they are unreal. When Kira returns, Vic invites her for dinner on the holodeck, and he invites Odo too, not telling him she is real.
