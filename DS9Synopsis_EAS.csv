"Emissary","S01E01-02","Three years after losing his wife Jennifer in the Battle of Wolf 359, Commander Benjamin Sisko is assigned as the new commander of a plundered space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. Having liberated themselves from sixty years of Cardassian rule, the newly established Bajoran provisional government is seeking Federation assistance for the task of rebuilding their pillaged planet. The discovery of the first stable wormhole into the Gamma Quadrant adds a strategic significance to the station, and when it is moved to the ""mouth"" of the wormhole, it becomes an attractive target for the Cardassians to recapture. The wormhole itself is inhabited by a non-corporeal species that have a religious significance to the Bajoran people to whom they refer as the ""Prophets"". It was prophesied that their ""Celestial Temple"" (the wormhole) would be found by an emissary, who in this case is none other than Commander Sisko himself."
"What You Leave Behind ","S07E25-26","Julian and Ezri wake up together on a day that should change everything. The uprising on Cardassia is the signal for the alliance to begin their final assault on the Dominion. The Cardassian people, however, pay a high price when the Jem'Hadar destroy the Lakarian City with its two million inhabitants. During the battle with the Federation alliance, the Cardassian ships, whose crews have just been notified of the massacre begin to fire on their former allies, the Breen and the Jem'Hadar. The female Founder now summons their ships and troops to Cardassia and she orders to slaughter all Cardassians. Damar, Kira and Garak are captured and are facing their execution, but they are saved by fellow Cardassian patriots. When the group storms the Dominion headquarters, Damar is fatally wounded. Garak kills Weyoun 8 and is pleased to hear that it was the last of his kind. The female Founder is taken prisoner. In the meantime, the Federation fleet has reached Cardassia and is preparing for the ultimate battle against what is left of the Dominion. Odo, however, beams down to Cardassia and links with the female Founder, thereby healing her. She agrees to a capitulation of the Dominion forces who retreat to the Gamma Quadrant. Odo decides to return to the Great Link to cure his people, which Kira sadly accepts. Worf becomes the Federation Ambassador to Qo'noS. O'Brien is about to leave to teach engineering at Starfleet Academy. In the Bajoran Fire Caves, the Pah-wraiths restore Dukat's Cardassian appearance. Sisko enters the scene. With the power of the Kosst Amojan Dukat kills Kai Winn. In a last effort to save Bajor, Sisko grabs Dukat, and they fall into the fire. The Kosst Amojan burn, thereby ensuring that the Pah-wraiths and Dukat have to stay in the caves forever. Sisko finds himself among the Prophets, who tell him that his mission is now finished and he needs rest. He has to stay with the Prophets. On the station, Kira and Jake are standing behind a promenade deck window, looking out at the vastness of space..."
"The Ascent","S05E09","Quark and Odo are on their way to a hearing, when Quark notices a whistling sound in the floor of the runabout. It is a bomb, obviously planted by the Orion Syndicate. They manage to contain the explosion in a transporter beam. Still, the small vessel crash lands on a desolate and cold Class-L planetoid. Quark suggests that they carry the emergency emitter to the top of a high mountain in order to increase its range. The two are already completely exhausted when they discover that the mountain is still days away. Moreover, Odo breaks his leg when the two slide down into a valley. Odo insists that Quark leave him behind. He is prepared to die when the Defiant arrives and beams him up."
"Past Prologue","S01E03","The Bajoran Tahna Los is beamed into DS9 after narrowly evading a pursuing Cardassian warship. Tahna belongs to the Khon-ma, a particularly ruthless terrorist group, and now seeks political asylum. Major Kira, who knows Tahna from her time in the resistance, supports the request in any way possible, acting against Commander Sisko. In the interim the two renegade Klingon sisters from the House of Duras, Lursa and B'Etor, have arrived on the station and meet with Tahna. He tries to enlist Kira's assistance to obtain a runabout but does not reveal his motive. His yet unknown goal is to detonate a bilitrium explosive, which he plans to purchase from the Duras sisters, to seal the entrance to the wormhole, and therefore eliminate the need for a Federation presence on Bajor. But the Duras sisters plan to double-cross Tahna and to deliver him to the Cardassians for a price. Sisko reluctantly allows Kira to accompany Tahna to the rendezvous with the Klingon sisters in the hope of revealing his intended target. Although Tahna manages to briefly elude Sisko and O'Brien, his plan is thwarted when Kira seizes control of the runabout, enters the wormhole, and detonates the device in the Gamma Quadrant."
"A Man Alone","S01E04","Odo is enraged when he meets Ibudan, a Bajoran who was convicted of murdering a Cardassian but was released from prison by the new Bajoran government. When Ibudan is murdered in a holosuite, Odo is the main suspect because evidently no other humanoid entered the holosuite. As a restless mob of the station's denizens gather to confront Odo, Bashir makes the startling discovery that the murder victim is in fact a clone, created and subsequently murdered by the real Ibudan in order to implicate Odo. In a final twist of irony, Ibudan is swiftly apprehended by Odo, and is accordingly charged with the murder of his own clone. Meanwhile, after Jake and his new Ferengi friend, Nog, are caught playing pranks on the promenade, Keiko O'Brien decides to open a school on the station."
"Babel","S01E05","In the midst of being inundated by a spate of maintenance requests, O'Brien inadvertently triggers a device that releases a virus, causing an advanced form of aphasia in his brain that makes him unable to communicate with anyone. As the virus keeps spreading through the food replicators and then mutates into an airborne strain, the station's officers gradually become incapacitated. Even worse, the virus turns out to be lethal. Bashir still finds out that not the Cardassians but the Bajorans created the virus before he is affected too. Kira travels to Bajor and kidnaps the co-creator of the virus, Surmak Ren, by beaming him into her runabout and infecting him as well. When Captain Jaheel tries to escape from the quarantined station and overloads his ship's engines, Odo and Quark have to work together to remove his ship from the docking ring. Surmak Ren soon manages to develop a cure based on Bashir's research."
"Captive Pursuit","S01E06","The station receives its first visitor from the Gamma Quadrant, an unannounced ship carrying a single lifeform, who happened to spot another ship going through the wormhole and followed it. As the visitor's starship is damaged and requires help in repairs, Sisko sends O'Brien to make first contact with the alien, who calls himself Tosk and seems to be nervous about something. When Tosk attempts to break into the station's weapons storage, Odo arrests the alien. Another starship from the Gamma Quadrant arrives and promptly scans the station. The crew of the new ship transport over and attempt to take Tosk forcibly. After a skirmish with station security the leader locates Tosk in his cell. After further negotiations Sisko learns that a ""Tosk"" is a lifeform bread to be hunted by the other aliens, the ""Hunters"". Under the terms of the Prime Directive, he agrees to hand over Tosk to the Hunters, knowing that they would display him in a cage for his failure to escape. O'Brien, however, frees Tosk, so the hunt can continue to everyone's satisfaction."
"Q-Less","S01E07","The runabout Ganges returns to the station with hardly any power and its crew and passenger in danger from lack of life support. Jadzia Dax and another crewman have returned with Vash after finding her in the Gamma Quadrant. With her is Q, who has been hounding Vash as a traveling companion for two years. Vash brings several artifacts to the station that she has acquired in the Gamma Quadrant, among them a remarkable crystal. She makes fast friends with Quark and agrees with the Ferengi profiteer to auction them off. Unbeknownst to the crew, however, the crystal draws energy from the station's power systems, leading to a massive build-up of gravitons that pushes the station towards the wormhole. Using ionized tritium, Dax is able to pinpoint the origin of the gravitons, and Sisko has the artifact beamed into space. There an embryonic lifeform frees itself from the crystal and vanishes into the wormhole."
"Dax","S01E08","Dr. Bashir attempts in vain to avoid the kidnapping of Jadzia Dax by a group of Klaestrons. Only the station's tractor beam can stop their departing ship. Ilon Tandro claims that Curzon Dax committed treason and was responsible for the killing of his father, General Ardelon Tandro, 30 years ago in the civil war on Klaestron IV. He demands the extradition of Jadzia Dax, which to decide about is up to a Bajoran arbiter, Els Renora. Sisko, however, argues that already the warrant is incorrect because if anyone, the former host Curzon or the symbiont Dax but not Jadzia committed a crime. Meanwhile on Klaestron IV, Odo finds out that Curzon was in bed with General Tandro's wife at the time he is said to have sent transmissions to the enemy, so the charges are dropped."
"The Passenger","S01E09","Major Kira and Dr. Bashir are aboard the Rio Grande when they respond to a distress signal sent by a Kobliad ship. They can rescue just the Kobliad security officer, Kajada. Her prisoner, Rao Vantika, grabs Bashir's neck and then dies. Back on the station, Kajada suspects that Vantika is still alive, for he has faked his death more than once. Also, a shipment of deuridium from the Gamma Quadrant is to arrive at the station, a substance essential for the survival of the Kobliad. While a DNA scan confirms that the body is indeed Vantika, Jadzia Dax theorizes that he could have transferred his consciousness to another person by injecting encoded glial cells to this person's body. This person is Dr. Bashir, who is now under the control of Vantika and who has enlisted help from mercenaries to hijack the deuridium freighter. When his plan is being foiled and the ship is secured by the station's tractor beam, Vantika threatens to go to warp, thereby killing Bashir and polluting the system with deuridium. But Jadzia succeeds in modulating the tractor beam with a frequency that would disable Vantika's cells in Bashir's body. After the glial cells have been beamed out, Kajada vaporizes them and thereby everything that is left of Vantika."
"Move Along Home","S01E10","A Vulcan ship has made contact with a new species in the Gamma Quadrant, the Wadi, and Sisko and his senior officers don their dress uniforms to greet them when they arrive at DS9. But all the visitors are interested in is Quark's games. After a while the Wadi catch the Ferengi cheating. As a penalty, Sisko, Dax, Bashir and Kira are trapped inside a game world controlled by the Wadi, while Quark is watching helplessly, reacting to the game as they go, in an attempt to free the officers. When Quark thinks that the officers are lost because of his fault, the Wadi leader declares that it was all just a game."
"The Nagus","S01E11","Grand Nagus Zek, the head of all Ferengi, appears on the station to hold a conference on developing business relations with the Gamma Quadrant. During the meeting with Ferengi delegates the old leader announces his retirement and totally unexpectedly declares that he has chosen Quark as his successor. This causes a great deal of unease among the assembled high-ranking Ferengi. Zek dies the next day as it seems. Soon someone attempts to assassinate the new Nagus Quark with a locator bomb. While Odo is investigating the case, the two assassins, Quark's brother Rom and Zek's son Krax, plan to finish their business and to blow Quark out of an airlock. But Odo and Zek, who feigned his death, thwart the plan. Zek, now knowing that Krax is no worthy successor, decides to exploit the business opportunities in the Gamma Quadrant himself."
"Vortex","S01E12","While Quark is negotiating the sale of an alien ""FabergÃ© egg"" with Miradorn twins, a man from the Gamma Quadrant enters the room, attempts to steal the egg and eventually kills one of the twins. Odo, after capturing him, finds out that the alien named Croden is wanted on his homeworld Rakhar for previous crimes, but also discovers the man knows something about Odo's kind, the Changelings. Croden shows him an artifact that can morph into a different shape just like Odo and that may be something like a distant relative. During the transport to Rakhar the Miradorn's twin brother comes after the pair. They enter a nebula, where Croden allegedly found the artifact and even met Changelings in person. But once they have landed on an asteroid, Croden uses the artifact as a key to the stasis chamber in which he kept his daughter safe, the only member of his family who survived the persecution. Odo steers the runabout into a pocket of toh-maire gas, where the Miradorn ship explodes when it fires its weapons. He eventually decides to let Croden and his daughter go."
"Battle Lines","S01E13","The station receives an unannounced visit from Kai Opaka, the spiritual leader of Bajor, whom Sisko offered a tour of the station. Knowing that no ship would pass the wormhole on this day for Opaka to watch, he invites the Kai to travel through the wormhole on a runabout, together with him, Kira and Bashir. In the Gamma Quadrant they follow the trace of a subspace signal to a moon with a satellite network, where the runabout is shot down and Opaka dies in the crash. But some time later she is alive again, because of artificially created microbes that have restored her body functions. The moon is a prison, to which the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis were exiled and where they can carry on with their conflict forever, thanks to the microbes. Sisko gathers representatives of the two factions to start peace talks, with the hope of getting all of them off that moon, but it ends in another bloody skirmish. In the meantime Bashir has discovered that the microbes only work in the special environment on the moon, which means that also Opaka has to stay behind. But Opaka has already decided for herself that it is her destiny to stay. After Jadzia and O'Brien have managed to create a gap in the satellite network, just Sisko, Kira and Bashir are beamed up."
"The Storyteller","S01E14","The station is hosting a conference on a conflict between the Paqu and the Navot on Bajor that has broken out because the Cardassians redirected a river that was laid down as the border between the two. The leader of the Paqu is Varis Sul, a teenage girl that catches Nog's attention. He and Jake befriend the girl and contribute their share to the solution, which keeps the border as it is but allows the Paqu, who would otherwise be cut off, free access to the river. Meanwhile, Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien have been sent to Bajor for a medical emergency. The two discover that an entity composed of energy periodically attacks the village, and does so while the pair are there. Aiding the dying sirah, a ""storyteller"", O'Brien helps back away the strange phenomenon the locals call ""Dal'Rok"". After saving the village the locals proclaim O'Brien as their new sirah, angering Hovath, the old sirah's apprentice. The Dal'Rok is in reality a manifestation of the village's anger and can be defeated only with unanimity. When O'Brien fails during another attack of the Dal'Rok, the young Hovath, who was always meant to be the successor but lacked the necessary determination so far, successfully takes over the task."
"Progress","S01E15","The station is assisting the Bajoran government in an energy transfer, tapping the molten core of Bajor's fifth moon Jeraddo in an attempt to provide energy for the planet. The moon holds some settlers, so Kira and Dax are dispatched with a runabout to make sure the evacuation is complete before the transfer begins. Sensors pick up lifeforms. Kira beams down to find a group of three Bajoran farmers, who refuse to leave their homes. Among them is an older man named Mullibok, who invites Kira for supper. Kira returns without the farmers. When she beams down again to Jeraddo with two security officers, they are being attacked and one of them shoots Mullibok. Kira stays on Jeraddo to care about the injured man. But although she sympathizes with him, Kira eventually decides that there is no way back and destroys his house. On the station, Jake and Nog make a bargain with Cardassian yamok sauce that Quark just wanted to get rid of."
"If Wishes Were Horses","S01E16","Various manifestations of the crew's imagination come to life, such as the 21st century baseball player Buck Bokai, the fairy-tale character Rumpelstiltskin, a sensual version of Dax that so far existed only in Bashir's mind and other strange effects. The real Dax attributes the phenomena to a possible subspace rupture forming near the station, of a kind that destroyed a whole solar system in the 23rd century. As such an anomaly is actually discovered and an attempt is made to collapse it, the rupture widens and threatens to destroy the station. But Sisko recognizes that the anomaly is just another product of everyone's imagination. The whole scenario was set up by an alien race in an attempt to understand the concept of imagination."
"The Forsaken","S01E17","A group of pompous Federation ambassadors arrive on the station, proceeding with a fact-finding mission concerning the wormhole. Sisko has the foresight to assign Dr. Bashir to escort them about the station while he prefers to tend to business. Among the ambassadors is Lwaxana Troi who develops an interest for Odo. Shortly afterwards a probe comes through the wormhole and after data has been downloaded from there, the station begins to experience strange malfunctions. A turbolift with Odo and Lwaxana Troi gets stuck, and there is no way of getting them out before Odo has to return to his liquid state. Lwaxana, however, assures him that there is nothing to be embarrassed about. O'Brien finally recognizes that the program behaves like a ""puppy"" that wants to be entertained, and so instead of trying to eliminate it he transfers it from the main system to a subroutine he calls a ""doghouse""."
"Dramatis Personae","S01E18","Kira suspects that a Valerian freighter scheduled to dock at the station is delivering weapons to Cardassia as they did during the occupation. But Sisko refuses her request to search the ship. The wormhole opens, and a Klingon cruiser returning from the Gamma Quadrant explodes just after exiting. The vessel's first officer is able to beam aboard the station, but dies after cryptically uttering the phrase ""Victory!"". In the following, the officers begin to behave strangely, and they form two factions aboard the station, one in support of Major Kira and one remaining loyal to Captain Sisko. The situation escalates when the opposing camps scheme to eliminate one another. Odo and Bashir manage to remove the cause for the tensions, a telepathic matrix created by the Saltah'nans that made the crew as well as the Klingons re-enact an ancient power struggle."
"Duet","S01E19","A Kobheerian freighter docking at the station requests medical help for a passenger it is transporting. The passenger turns out to be a Cardassian named Marritza with a case of Kalla-Nohra Syndrome, a disease that was exclusively diagnosed in Gallitep, a former Cardassian labor camp on Bajor. Kira Nerys has Marritza placed under arrest and delves into his background. After visual evidence from the camp has been unearthed, the man has to admit he is Gul Darhe'el, the notorious commandant of Gallitep. But after Odo's further investigation it turns out that he really is Marritza, who served as a filing clerk in Gallitep. By altering his face and posing as one of the biggest war criminals in Bajoran history he wanted to make the case public and help alleviate Cardassia's and his own guilt. When Marritza is released and about to return to his home planet, a Bajoran appears from the crowd and stabs him - apparently just because Marritza is a Cardassian."
"In the Hands of the Prophets","S01E20","Keiko O'Brien is conducting class when Vedek Winn shows up and confronts her about her non-religious teachings. Using this as a platform Winn then calls for a boycott of the school and foments fervor against the Federation. Tensions between the Bajorans and Starfleet rise further, and a bomb destroys the classroom. In the meantime O'Brien is investigating the disappearance of his staff member Aquino, only to discover that he has been murdered by someone whom must have caught tampering with a runabout. O'Brien finds evidence that Neela, a Bajoran member of his staff, is the culprit. Vedek Bareil, Winn's rival in the election of the new Bajoran Kai, appears on the station, and Neela's attempt to kill him and escape with a runabout is foiled in the last moment. She was acting on behalf of Kai Winn, whose activities lured her opponent to the station. Yet, her involvement in the scheme remains unproven."
"The Homecoming","S02E01","Quark shows Major Kira an earring, a cue that Li Nalas, the greatest hero of the Bajoran Resistance, may still be alive in a Cardassian prisoner camp. She and O'Brien actually find Li on a secret site on Cardassia IV. But they have to leave some of the other Bajoran prisoners behind. Gul Dukat surprisingly apologizes for the existence of the camp and promises that all detainees be released soon. Meanwhile on Deep Space 9, an extremist Bajoran group named ""Alliance for Global Unity"" or simply ""The Circle"" demands that all aliens leave Bajor. In order to help pacify his people, Li Nalas, whose role in the fight against Cardassia is vastly overrated, reluctantly accepts his new position as ""navarch"" and liaison officer on Deep Space 9, while Minister Jaro recalls Kira to Bajor."
"The Circle","S02E02","Kira Nerys accepts Bareil's invitation to his monastery where she recognizes in an Orb vision that she has fallen in love with the vedek. When Odo, with the help of Quark, investigates weapon shipments from the Kressari to The Circle, he finds out that actually the Cardassians are responsible for the deal because they want to destabilize Bajor and take over the wormhole. On Bajor, Kira is anesthetized and kidnapped. When she wakes up, Minister Jaro reveals that he is the leader of The Circle. Sisko, Bashir and Li manage to free Kira and take her back to the station, while The Circle in the form of Jaro and Vedek Winn is preparing to seize power on Bajor and to attack the station - unbeknownst of the fact that everything is a Cardassian ploy."
"The Siege","S02E03","Most denizens of Deep Space 9 leave the station in a hurry in order to escape the imminent attack of the Bajoran military. Soon Bajoran forces arrive to take over the station, unaware that Commander Sisko and a small team of Starfleet officers are still hiding there together with Li Nalas. Kira and Dax embark an old Bajoran fighter craft to get to Bajor, but they are shot down above the planet. They are found by a search team sent by Bareil and proceed to the Bajoran Chamber of Ministers. When Kira tells the ministers about the Cardassian involvement, everyone, including Winn, turns against the shattered Jaro. In the meantime on Deep Space 9, Sisko and his crew have managed to convince General Krim of the occupation forces to retreat. Only Colonel Day refuses to leave. When the fanatic officer aims his phaser at Sisko, Li Nalas leaps into the line of fire and is fatally injured."
"Invasive Procedures","S02E04","During a plasma storm Deep Space 9 is manned only with a skeleton crew, when a transport ship sends a distress call and requests to dock. The Trill Verad, a woman named Mareel and the two Klingon mercenaries T'Kar and Yeto come aboard the station. They pull weapons, confine Odo to a stasis box, injure O'Brien and take everyone else hostage. Verad's plan is to get hold of the Dax symbiont. Under the threat that otherwise everyone would be killed, but knowing that it will likely kill Jadzia once the symbiont is removed, Dr. Bashir performs the procedure. Ben Sisko attempts to convince his new ""friend"" Verad Dax and later Verad's lover Mareel (who is disappointed about his change) to return the Dax symbiont. In the meantime Quark and Bashir get rid of their Klingon guard dogs and free Odo. When Verad leaves in a hurry and a struggle between his aides and the crew ensues, Sisko takes a phaser and fires at Verad - allowing Bashir to return the Dax symbiont to Jadzia who now hosts a part of Verad's memories and personality."
"Cardassians","S02E05","Garak makes the unpleasant acquaintance of Rugal, a Cardassian boy who has been raised by Bajorans and who now hates his own race. Gul Dukat insists to investigate the case, but Garak gives Dr. Bashir a cue that the boy, like other Cardassian orphans, was left behind on Bajor on Dukat's orders. Dukat later reveals that the boy is the son of Pa'Dar, an influential politician on Cardassia. Bashir and Garak take a shuttle to the orphanage on Bajor where any record about Rugal is missing. It turns out that Dukat deliberately separated the boy from his father and erased the evidence in the hopes of humiliating his political opponent. Sisko decides that, although the Bajoran foster father named Proka loves Rugal as if he were his own child, the boy should be returned to Pa'Dar."
"Melora","S02E06","The cartographer Ensign Melora Pazlar, an Elaysian who is used to very low gravity, arrives at the station. Although she needs a wheelchair to move in environments with nominal gravity, she insists on being treated like everyone else. But she experiences her limits when she drops to the floor and doesn't manage to get up until help arrives. Julian Bashir, who is romantically involved with the Elaysian, surprises Melora with the proposal to adapt her neuromuscular system to normal gravity, even though then she would have to give up her frequent ""flights"" in low gravity. When Fallit Kot, a sinister trade partner of Quark's, hijacks her and Dax's runabout, Melora saves the day when she deactivates the gravity generators and overwhelms Kot. She eventually decides to decline the proposed treatment."
"Rules of Acquisition","S02E07","Grand Nagus Zek has great news for Quark: The simple bar owner has been chosen to purchase tulaberry wine from the Dosi from the Gamma Quadrant, as a preparation for a large-scale trade agreement. When his Ferengi waiter Pel advises him to be cautious, Quark is impressed and assigns Pel to be his assistant. But Pel is actually a female, who is disguised as a man to escape the strict gender roles in the Ferengi society. The deal with the Dosi fails. However, Pel convinces Zek to let them further pursue their goals. With Zek's blessing, she and Quark head for the Gamma Quadrant where they learn of the Karemma who would bring the Ferengi in contact with the Dominion - which is ultimately more valuable than the wine. Back on the station, Quark faints when he is notified by Rom that Pel is a woman who loves him. When Pel reveals her gender to Zek as well, the Ferengi decide to remain silent about it - as it is outlawed for a businessman to take advice from a woman."
"Necessary Evil","S02E08","The Bajoran woman Vaatrik Pallra hires Quark to retrieve a strongbox hidden on the station during the Cardassian occupation. He and Rom sneak about on the promenade deck and find the box when a man named Trazko, obviously sent by Pallra, takes the list of names that was inside and shoots Quark. Odo questions Rom about the incident when he suddenly finds himself in a conversation with Gul Dukat, five years earlier on Terok Nor. At that time Pallra's husband Mr. Vaatrick, a shop owner, had been murdered, and Pallra suspected his alleged mistress, Kira Nerys. Back in the present, Rom remembers just one name from the list, which he thinks was Ches'so. But Pallra denies any knowledge of either the list or someone with that name. Yet, Odo is sure that she is blackmailing former collaborators like the said person, whose real name is Ches'sarro Seeto. Now Ches'saro has mysteriously died. Five years in the past, Odo interrogates Kira who has paid Quark in order to provide a false alibi for her. She says it was to cover up her sabotage of the ore processors. Odo lies to Dukat about this interrogation in order to save her life. Back in the present, Trazko attempts in vain to assassinate Quark, who is still in the infirmary. Odo, however, realizes that Kira did indeed kill Mr. Vaatrick because he was a collaborator and that it was her friends of the Resistance who exterminated Ches'saro."
"Second Sight","S02E09","On the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Wolf 359 in which his wife Jennifer died, Benjamin Sisko falls in love a woman named Fenna he encounters on the promenade deck. But Fenna suddenly runs away when the commander meets her a second time. The same night, he and his senior staff attend a dinner with Dr. Seyetik on the USS Prometheus. The famous scientist has developed a method to re-ignite dying stars in order to revive orbiting planets. Much to Sisko's surprise, Seyetik's wife Nidell looks exactly like Fenna, but she doesn't recognize the commander. He is even more taken aback to find Fenna, who says she knows nothing about Nidell, in his quarters, only to see her disappear after a passionate kiss. On their mission to a dead star Dax reveals that Fenna is composed of energy. She is just a projection created by Nidell, who is a psychoprojective telepath and obviously bored by her marriage with Seyetik. Stricken with guilt, the scientist takes a shuttle and commits suicide when he heads for the star, which he recuperates through his sacrifice. Nidell is now free; but Fenna, the part of her that loved Sisko, is gone."
"Sanctuary","S02E10","When a transport vessel entering through the wormhole breaks apart, its passengers are beamed to Deep Space 9. After the universal translator initially fails to provide a proper translation, it later becomes clear that the people from the Gamma Quadrant are Skrreeans who lost their home to a race called T-Rogorans and ultimately to the Dominion. There are three million more Skrreeans waiting on the far side of the ""Eye"", the wormhole, as their leader, a woman called Haneek explains. While Sisko has found an empty planet for the Skrreeans to settle down, Haneek is convinced that their lost home is Bajor. But the Bajorans refuse to let the refugees immigrate. Haneek's son Tumak takes a shuttle to Bajor that explodes due to a radiation leak when Bajoran fighters attempt to stop him. Shattered about the loss, Haneek gives in, but not without accusing the Bajorans of being apprehensive and mistrustful."
"Rivals","S02E11","While in Odo's holding cell, the notorious El-Aurian swindler Martus Mazur takes a gambling device from a dead fellow prisoner. So equipped, he opens a casino on the promenade deck when he is released. He gains the widow Roana and Quark's brother Rom as associates. Much to Quark's displeasure the ""Club Martus"" soon abounds with guests, who at some point all simultaneously win in the casino - whereas occurrences of bad luck are reported from everywhere on Deep Space 9. When Quark strikes back and wins O'Brien and Bashir for a charity racquetball match, something is strange. O'Brien, who normally wouldn't stand a chance, doesn't miss a single ball. It turns out that the gaming device is changing the probability for the neutron spin throughout the station. Commander Sisko rules that the devices have to be destroyed. Martus, however, has been duped himself by Roana, who has taken his earnings to invest them into a non-existent asteroid mining project."
"The Alternate","S02E12","Dr. Mora Pol, the scientist who took care of Odo after he was found (and the prototype for the shapeshifter's hairstyle), visits the station with a possible clue to Odo's origin. Odo, Mora, Dax and the Mora's assistant Dr. Weld take a runabout to a planet in the Gamma Quadrant where they locate a tiny lifeform that may be related to Odo. But then poisonous volcanic gases erupt, and only the seemingly unaffected Odo can save the rest of the away team. Back on Deep Space 9, the three injured scientists are taken to the infirmary. O'Brien carries on with the studies but then the science lab in which he keeps the lifeform is demolished, apparently by the lifeform itself which is missing. But a more detailed analysis of Dr. Mora comes to the conclusion that Odo must be the culprit. The security chief doesn't believe his mentor until he morphs into the violent creature. Shutting off the power on the station, the crew manages to capture Odo in a forcefield and remove the traces of the detrimental gas from his substance."
"Armageddon Game","S02E13","Aboard a T'Lani vessel, Dr. Bashir and Miles O'Brien assist the T'Lani and the Kellerun in the destruction of the Harvester, a biological agent that was used in the long war between the two planets. Suddenly two Kellerun soldiers enter the room and begin firing. The two Starfleet officers manage to beam down to the planet T'Lani III, but O'Brien has been infected with Harvester. Kellerun and T'Lani officials inform Deep Space 9 that the two officers are dead. But Keiko O'Brien notices an inconsistency in the security tape because she insists on her husband never drinking coffee in the late afternoon. In orbit of T'Lani Dax and Sisko discover that the shuttle log has been tampered with as well.

They examine the matter in the station's science lab. Jadzia Dax ponders whether to go easy on Arjin or to be as blunt as Curzon Dax once was to her. She decides to do the latter, leaving Arjin angry and disappointed. Unfortunately Cardassian voles, rodents living on the station, damage the containment field. Now the protoplasm, which turns out to be a protouniverse containing life, is expanding.

The monk Prylar Bek revealed their whereabouts to the Cardassians and then committed suicide.

His plan is to meet and to come to terms with the mysterious Founders of the Dominion in the Gamma Quadrant. Odo, who has been replaced by Commander Eddington as head of security, grudgingly joins the Defiant crew. They proceed into the Gamma Quadrant under cloak.

Quark, who sees an opportunity to revive his business, takes credit for slaying the Klingon. When Kozak's brother D'Ghor arrives, the paradoxical Klingon logic requires that Quark maintain his claim, because only this way Kozak would have died honorably and D'Ghor would spare the Ferengi's life. Kozak's wife Grillka, on the other hand, is vitally interested in rebutting Quark's pretension, for she could only inherit the reign over the House of Kozak if her husband had died accidentally; otherwise D'Ghor would be the heir. She takes Quark to Qo'noS to marry him, and Gowron instates the Ferengi as the provisional leader of the House of Quark. When the two discover that D'Ghor has been systematically harming Kozak's financial interests, they take the case to the High Council.

They take the Defiant to the Trill homeworld to consult Dr. Renhol of the Symbiosis Commission. Timor, one of the unjoined Trills taking care of the symbionts senses there is something wrong with one of the Dax hosts. Dax is plagued by hallucinations again, apparently of a time some 80 years ago. The music was composed by a man named Joran Belar living in that time. When Dax goes into neural shock, Dr. Renhol rules that the Dax symbiont has to be removed at the host's expense if their condition doesn't improve.

To Dr. Bashir's surprise the child grows to the equivalent of an eight-year-old boy who can speak in a matter of a few hours. The boy is a young Jem'Hadar. Odo, who is afraid that the boy may end up as a lab rat like he used to be one himself, receives Sisko's approval to work with the young Jem'Hadar.

Gul Dukat appears on the station's monitors and announces the countermeasures. The Ops and the security office are sealed likewise, and the station is slated to be flooded with neurocine gas. Garak is the only one who can penetrate the forcefield around the Ops thanks to his still working security code. He gives Kira the advice to destroy the life support system to stop the gas. But the phaser blast sets off the countdown to the station's self destruction. The sadistically amused real Gul Dukat arrives to witness the desperate efforts to save the station. But when he attempts to beam out, a recording of his former superior appears on the screen and declares that Dukat is not allowed to leave his post. He now has to work with the Deep Space 9 crew. Dax manages to free Sisko, Jake and O'Brien from their prison by taking down all forcefields through a station-wide power surge. With not enough time left to stop the self-destruct, Sisko decides to let the shields absorb the explosion of the fusion reactor, and the station survives with some damage."
"Meridian","S03E08","In the Gamma Quadrant the Defiant crew witness how a planet appears where there was previously none. A woman named Setlin invites them to their world.

The hijacker is actually Thomas Riker, Will's duplicate who came to life in a transporter accident several years ago and who is now with the Maquis. Sisko and Odo reluctantly inform Dukat of the hijacking. In the eyes of the Cardassians the search for the warship may justify a brutal invasion of the Demilitarized Zone between them and the Federation. Working with Dukat and Korinas from the Obsidian Order, Sisko has to reveal that the cloaked ship may be detected with the help of an antiproton beam. But Kira manages to disable the cloaking. During the repairs Riker reveals that his target is the Orias system where the Cardassians supposedly build an invasion fleet. When Sisko, too, suspects that the Defiant's destination is Orias, Korinas denies Dukat's vessels the admission to the system. Suddenly three warships of the Obsidian Order, which is not even supposed to have ships, enter the scene. Dukat, who is just as surprised as Sisko, agrees to a deal with the Starfleet officer.

Sisko realizes that he and Bashir have arrived just before the Bell Riots, in which desperate homeless people would take hostages. Their lives would be saved by the sacrifice of a man named Gabriel Bell. But Gabriel Bell is killed prematurely as a result of Sisko's and Bashir's presence in that time. As the riots begin, Sisko joins the crowd, pretending to be Gabriel Bell.

To everyone's relief only two Cardassian women arrive, but a third one is going to join them. Kira is concerned but doesn't permit her faith to interfere with her duty. When, however, a part of the prophecy, a ""sword of stars"" in the form of a comet near the far wormhole exit seems to come true, she urges Sisko to end the experiment. Sisko decides to carry on regardless, with the outcome that the comet is heading for the wormhole inside which it would cause the anomaly to collapse. With modified phasers the Defiant attempts to vaporize the comet, but Dejar, one of the Cardassians, has sabotaged the weapons. The comet breaks apart into three chunks - apparently the three vipers mentioned in the prophecy.

Dax theorizes that the radiation exposure makes O'Brien shift forward in time. The second time shift occurs, and O'Brien finds himself in a brawl between Romulans and Klingons in Quark's bar, which actually happens five hours later. In the third time travel O'Brien witnesses how he is killed when opening a wall panel in a corridor. The Klingons will place a device there to spy on the Romulan delegates.

After Dax has found out that a quantum singularity triggers the frequent time shifts, O'Brien shifts once again and finds himself on a crowded runabout from where he sees how Deep Space 9 explodes and the wormhole collapses. In order to arrive at an earlier date to find out what destroyed the station, Dr. Bashir gives O'Brien a device that floods his body with delta isotopes to trigger the time shift, although it could be too much for him. In the future it becomes clear that a cloaked Romulan Warbird, which uses a quantum singularity as its power source, is responsible for the attack. The weakened time-traveling O'Brien hands over the device to his future self who travels back to warn Sisko. The commander locks torpedoes onto the quantum singularity, and the Romulans choose to retreat."

"Improbable Cause / The Die is Cast","S03E20-21","An explosion shatters Garak's tailor shop on Deep Space 9. Partially due to Garak's unwillingness to talk, Odo does not find any solid evidence against the main suspect, a Flaxian named Retaya. Upon leaving the station Retaya's ship explodes, apparently because of Romulan sabotage. Odo surmises that Garak himself is responsible for the explosion in his shop to get the security chief involved. When he tells Garak that five Cardassian agents died in unfortunate accidents the same day that the shop was blown up, Garak becomes uneasy that someone might kill his mentor Enabran Tain, the former head of the Obsidian Order, likewise. Odo and Garak take a runabout to investigate Tain's recent disappearance when they are pulled inside a Romulan Warbird. To their surprise they find Tain who has forged an alliance between the Obsidian Order and the Romulan Tal Shiar under Colonel Lovok. A combined fleet of Warbirds and the ships that the Obsidian Order secretly built in the Orias system is going to destroy the Founders' homeworld in the Delta Quadrant. Garak was actually on Tain's assassination list as he could know too much, but now Tain grants him an opportunity to redeem himself - by torturing Odo in order to find out more about the Founders. Sisko is warned by Starfleet of the imminent military operation, and is ordered to stand by to be prepared for retaliatory attacks of the Jem'Hadar. But Sisko takes the Defiant to the Gamma Quadrant, hoping to find Odo on one of the attacking vessels. Commander Eddington, however, disables the cloaking under orders of Starfleet Command. On the Warbird, Garak finally disables the restriction device and allows Odo to return to his fluid state. In orbit of the planet known to be the Founders' homeworld, all 19 Cardassian and Romulan ships open fire and devastate the surface. But the planet has been evacuated, and a fleet of 150 Jem'Hadar vessels ambush the Romulan-Cardassian fleet which is totally destroyed. With the help of Lovok, who is actually a Founder, Garak and Odo manage to escape and are rescued by the Defiant."
"Explorers","S03E22","Sisko returns from Bajor with plans of an 800-year-old starship design, propelled only by solar wind. According to legend, Bajorans even crossed the interstellar distance to Cardassia in such ships, which Gul Dukat calls a ""fairy tale"". Jake overcomes his initial reluctance and joins his father, who is building the ship with very few concessions to modern times. They launch the vessel, and Jake uses the opportunity to tell his father about his plan to attend Pennington School in New Zealand. Soon they have to abandon one sail. Moreover, their vessel is caught in some sort of eddy. Thanks to tachyons, which have accelerated the sailing ship to warp speed, they wind up near Cardassia where Gul Dukat congratulates them and concedes that recently discovered ruins on Cardassia prove the existence of ancient Bajoran visitors."
"Family Business","S03E23","Liquidator Brunt of the Ferengi Commerce Authority (FCA) presents Quark a writ of accountability because his mother is charged with making profit - which is illegal for women in the Ferengi Alliance. He and Rom travel to Ferenginar to make her sign a confession. They are shocked that their mother is also wearing clothes - which is considered indecent for women. Ishka admits that she made a profit of three bars of latinum. But Quark later discovers that it is actually much more, so much that it would ruin him, as he would have to refund it should she refuse. Infuriated that Ishka pretends to have the better lobes for business, he nonetheless decides to denounce his mother, and only Rom can stop him with the false story that she would share the profit. Eventually Ishka gives up, signs the confession and vows to pay back the profit. But, as she tells only Rom in private, just a third of her actual profit was accounted for."

Winn calls Kira to help her retrieve soil reclamators from a group of stubborn farmers in Kira's home province Dakhur. Among them is Shakaar Edon who led Kira's resistance cell during the Cardassian occupation. But Shakaar refuses to give the reclamators back that he thinks are more urgently needed to feed his people than to produce for export in the Rakantha province. When Winn sends troops to arrest Shakaar, Kira joins his group and hides in the mountains for weeks. They finally agree to a cease-fire with General Lenaris Holem. Lenaris takes the pair to Winn's office where Shakaar announces that he would run for prime minister.

In the following the changeling continues to fool the crew among whom suspicion arises that anyone could be the intruder. Odo discovers that Sisko is bleeding, inferring that he can't be a changeling because parts separated from the body would return to their gelatinous state. Now they have found a method to expose the changeling. But with the Defiant entering Tzenkethi space with activated weapons, Sisko has to order the ship's self-destruction, giving O'Brien only ten minutes to regain control.

Garak has placed a bomb on the shuttle, thereby getting the Romulans to declare war on the Dominion and leaving one Starfleet officer with a very bad conscience."
"His Way","S06E20","When Kira travels to Bajor to meet with Shakaar, the jealous Odo seeks advice in Dr. Bashir's new holosuite program set in a Las Vegas casino. The local singer called Vic Fontaine, an unusually sophisticated hologram, introduces Odo to some holographic women to gain practice, including a reproduction of Kira. But Odo can't ignore that they are unreal. When Kira returns, Vic invites her for dinner on the holodeck, and he invites Odo too, not telling him she is real. Odo is embarrassed when he learns the truth after treating Kira like a hologram. But when the two later have an argument on the promenade deck, Odo brings himself to kiss her."
"The Reckoning","S06E21","In the ancient city of B'hala on Bajor archeologists find a tablet addressing the Emissary. Looking at the tablet, Sisko has a vision of the Prophets who tell him that the ""Reckoning"" must begin. At Kai Winn's urging Sisko agrees to return the tablet. But suddenly he smashes it on the floor, releasing a strange form of energy. On the promenade deck a Prophet appears in the body of Major Kira. Even though Sisko is shocked that his son Jake hosts the opponent, a Pah-wraith, he allows the battle to take place against the advice of his staff. It is Kai Winn, worried by the fact that her faith is not strong enough, who ends the Reckoning prematurely when she activates a chroniton emitter that was installed by the Starfleet crew."
"Valiant","S06E22","Jake and Nog are traveling to Ferenginar when a Jem'Hadar ship attacks. They are beamed out from the shuttle and find themselves on a Defiant-class vessel, the USS Valiant. The ship's regular staff has been killed, leaving a group of Red Squad cadets in charge, led by the provisional ""Captain"" Watters. While Nog is excited to work together with Red Squad, Jake has doubts about the irrational unconditional team spirit on the Valiant. When Watters orders an assault on a vastly superior Dominion battleship prototype, Jake is put into the brig. The Dominion vessel suffers only superficial damage, whereas the Valiant is crippled and destroyed. Only Jake, Nog and ""Chief"" Collins survive the debacle in an escape pod, and are picked up by the Defiant."
"Profit and Lace","S06E23","Zek has been disposed of his position as Grand Nagus because of his relationship with and support for the feminist Ishka, Quark's and Rom's mother. Brunt is now the acting Grand Nagus, and will permanently take this position unless Zek gets support from the commissioners of the FCA within three days. Ishka is ready to meet with ""Slug-o-Cola"" manufacturer Nilva, but during an argument with Quark she suffers a heart attack. It is now up to Quark to play the role of a Ferengi female to convince Nilva of the feminist idea, for which purpose he is altered using a hormone treatment. When Brunt blows the whistle on the ruse, Quark can prove, thanks to the hormones, that he is a real female. Nilva promises to support Ishka and Zek."

The crew manages to retrieve Molly from the portal, but the calculations are off by ten years. The Molly that returns has spent a whole decade alone on the planet. The O'Briens prepare a special room with a tree and a holodeck simulation for their savage daughter, but when she injures a guest of Quark's bar, Federation officials decide that she better be taken to a care center. Unwilling to give their daughter away and worried about her welfare, the O'Briens make a hard decision: They return Molly to where she came from, 300 years into the future on the alien planet. When 18-year-old Molly arrives there, she encounters her sad young counterpart and sends her back through the portal."
"The Sound of Her Voice","S06E25","The Defiant picks up a distress call by the marooned Captain Lisa Cusak whose ship has crashed on a remote Class-L planet. A regular communication is established, and the stranded captain becomes friends with many of the crew. The Defiant arrives at the planet just before the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere becomes lethal for Cusak. However, the planet is surrounded by an energy barrier that does not permit beaming. Sisko, O'Brien and Bashir take a bumpy shuttle ride down to the surface - only to find that Lisa Cusak has died three years ago. Obviously the energy barrier caused a time shift in the subspace signals."
"Tears of the Prophets","S06E26","The Federation Alliance decides to launch a major offensive against the Dominion and to invade Cardassian space, beginning with the Chin'toka system. Sisko receives a warning from the Prophets to stay on the station, but he decides in favor of his duty as a Starfleet officer. He puts Dax in charge of Deep Space 9. The Chin'toka system is protected by a series of orbital weapon platforms which become active amidst the battle. The Alliance gains the upper hand when the weapon platforms can be tricked in firing on their own power generator. Meanwhile on the station, Dukat, now possessed by a Pah-wraith, appears in the Bajoran shrine where he disables the Orb and lethally injures Jadzia Dax. Dr. Bashir can save the Dax symbiont, but not the Jadzia host. The Bajoran wormhole closes, and all Orbs go dark, indicating that the Prophets have left Bajor. Sisko is shattered and takes an indefinite leave, returning to New Orleans on Earth."

This woman turns out to be his real mother, Sarah. A locket that belonged to Sarah shows an old Bajoran inscription which hints to a yet unknown Orb of the Emissary. Despite an attempt on his life obviously by a member of the Pah-wraith cult, Sisko goes searching for this Orb, together with his father Joseph, his son Jake and Ezri, the new Dax host. Meanwhile, the Romulans establish a hospital complex on the Bajoran moon Derna, but also install plasma torpedoes there. Worf is eager to undertake a dangerous mission to allow Jadzia to enter Sto-vo-kor. On the planet Tyree Sisko discovers the Orb of the Emissary. The Prophet from the Orb enters the wormhole and expels the Pah-wraith. Kira's blockade against the Romulans succeeds, and they remove their weapons from the Bajoran moon.

"Afterimage","S07E03","Sisko expects Ezri to stay as the station's counselor, but the crew have difficulties to get accustomed to the new Dax host, and vice versa. While everyone gives her at least a warm welcome, Worf avoids Ezri, believing that to be friendly to her would dishonor his wife's memory. Sisko gives Ezri the task of helping Garak when he begins to have claustrophobic attacks. When her work seems to fail, she is about to resign from Starfleet, but she eventually finds out the true reason for Garak's claustrophobia, that he feels like he is betraying his people. After talking to Worf, Ezri decides to stay."
"Take Me Out to the Holosuite","S07E04","The Vulcan Captain Solok is an old rival of Sisko's who uses every opportunity to prove that Vulcans are superior to humans.

Sisko gathers all his crew and friends. Although they give their best, the ""Niners"" eventually lose the match, winning just one strike, but not without the moral victory on their side as they believe."

Knowing that they don't have the basis for a relationship, Sarina leaves the station."
"Treachery, Faith and the Great River","S07E06","Having expected a Cardassian defector, Odo is surprised to find Weyoun at the meeting point. After the previous Weyoun 5 had died, this Weyoun 6 was activated but exhibited too much of a conscience of his own. When Weyoun 6 was about to be replaced by still another clone, Weyoun 7, he decided to defect and reveal secrets of the Dominion to the Federation to end the killing. When their runabout is chased by Jem'Hadar who were not told that a Founder is aboard, Weyoun 6 sees no other solution than to commit suicide to prevent Odo from being killed, but not before revealing that a deadly disease is spreading among the Founders.

"Once More Unto the Breach","S07E07","Kor, the old Dahar Master, requests a command from Worf so he can die as a warrior.

When the small Klingon attack group of Birds-of-Prey is being pursued by a fleet of Jem'Hadar ships, Worf vows to stay behind with one ship and sacrifice himself to allow the rest of the Klingons to escape. Kor, however, knocks out Worf and beams over to the ship that is to distract the Jem'Hadar. He dies a glorious death in battle, thereby saving his comrades."

On a reconnaissance mission to the Jem'Hadar camp, Nog is severely hurt, and Bashir has to amputate his leg. In the meantime, Ezri and engineer Kellin have found a way to disable Dominion anti-personnel mines that hide in subspace and use them against the Jem'Hadar. With most of them killed by the mines, Starfleet fights a fierce battle against the remaining Jem'Hadar and eventually wins, but takes heavy losses too."
"Covenant","S07E09","Using a long-range transporter, Kira is kidnapped to Empok Nor where a community of Pah-wraith worshippers has settled, their charismatic leader being no one else but ex-Gul Dukat.

When it is discovered that the unborn child of his Bajoran follower Mika is half-Cardassian (with Dukat being the father, of course), Dukat claims that it is a miracle, but later attempts to kill Mika.

However, Ezri's brothers, Janel who has a leading position in the company and in particular the shy and artistically skilled Norvo, are delighted to see her. O'Brien is found, and so is the body of Mrs. Bilby. She was on the payroll of the Tigan company because they owed a favor to the Orion Syndicate, but she soon became a problem when she raised her demands.

She discovers that the victims had in common that they all had photos of laughing people in their quarters. When she accidentally meets the Vulcan Chu'lak in the turbolift, Joran knows that he must be the culprit - the Vulcan, as someone who is used to suppress his emotions, was offended by the hilarity.

"Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang","S07E15","The Las Vegas holosuite is taken over by the mobster Frankie Eyes who lays off Vic.

"Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges","S07E16","Just before he is leaving for a conference on Romulus, Bashir is visited by Sloan who wants him to gather data on Romulus for Section 31. Sisko recommends that Bashir should take over the task, and if only to gather information about Section 31. On their way to Romulus, Sloan tells Bashir that he is to examine Koval of the Tal Shiar who may suffer from the Tuvan syndrome. Bashir, however, suspects that Section 31 may use the information about the illness to kill Koval, a declared opponent of the Federation. When Admiral Ross suffers an aneurysm, Bashir sees no other chance than to consult Romulan Senator Cretak, who then tries to get access to Koval's files to find a possible traitor in the Romulan Senate. Bashir is arrested and, after an unsuccessful attempt to scan his brain, finds himself in a Romulan courtroom, together with Cretak and Sloan as the other defendants. Sloan denies that Section 31 even exists but claims that he wanted to kill Koval for personal revenge. When Sloan tries to escape, he is seemingly vaporized by a disruptor, but actually he is beamed up secretly. The whole affair was a hoax devised by Sloan and supported by Ross to discredit Cretak and get Koval, who is a secret supporter of the Romulan-Federation alliance, into a better position."
"Penumbra","S07E17","Worf is reported missing in action after the Klingon ship he was commanding was destroyed by the Jem'Hadar. Ezri, determined to find him, sets out alone in a runabout. She finds Worf in the Badlands, but their runabout is attacked by the Jem'Hadar, and they have to beam down to a planet. After a few days on the planet, they don't manage to suppress their feelings for each other any longer, but they are soon interrupted by the Breen who capture them. Sisko and Kasidy are preparing for their wedding, although Sisko has a vision in which the Prophets do not approve of it. In the Dominion headquarters, the female Founder shows signs of a serious disease that makes it hard for her to maintain her shape. Damar is surprised when he sees that Dukat has been surgically altered to appear as a Bajoran."
"'Til Death Do Us Part","S07E18","Sisko is uncertain whether he should heed the warnings of the Prophets or follow his heart. Although he has still another vision in which the Prophets want to talk him out of it, he finally decides to let the wedding with Kasidy take place. In a small ceremony on Deep Space 9, Admiral Ross pronounces them husband and wife. Kai Winn, after many years, seemingly has her first vision of the Prophets who tell her that a ""guide"" will help her in the ""restoration"" of Bajor. This guide appears in the form of Dukat who now calls himself ""Anjohl"" and claims to be a Bajoran farmer. Aboard the Breen ship, Ezri inadvertently confesses to Worf that she loves Julian. They do not know why they are held captive until they learn that the Breen are now allies of the Dominion, and Ezri and Worf are a gift for Weyoun."
"Strange Bedfellows","S07E19","Kai Winn is horrified when she learns that her visions are actually not from the Prophets, but from the despised Pah-wraiths. She seeks the advice of Kira Nerys who tells her that now would be the time to resign, but Winn decides to follow the way of the Pah-wraiths. Damar is upset when he learns that Cardassia will lose some of its territory to the Breen. He is anything but sad that Worf kills Weyoun 7 when he insults the Klingon, whereupon Worf and Ezri are due for execution. Damar's grudge against the Dominion becomes even worse when Weyoun 8 does nothing to support the Cardassian troops on Septimus III, resulting in the loss of 500,000 lives. Damar frees Worf and Ezri, telling them that he is now an ally of the Federation."
"The Changing Face of Evil","S07E20","As Worf and Ezri return to DS9, they learn that the Breen have destroyed Starfleet Headquarters on Earth. Winn Adami and ""Anjohl"" Dukat study the ancient Bajoran book of the Kosst Amojan that explains how the Pah-wraiths can be freed from the Fire Caves. The pages seem to be empty. Winn's assistant Solbor unveils Anjohl's true identity. Winn stabs him with a knife, and the blood renders the text visible. When the Dominion, supported by the Breen, attack the Chin'toka system, countless allied starships, including the USS Defiant, are destroyed by a new Breen weapon that disables a ship's power systems. In the meantime, on Cardassia, Damar has gathered loyal troops to fight against the Dominion occupation. Sisko, knowing that the Federation now needs any help it can get, decides to support Damar."
"When It Rains","S07E21","It is discovered that one Klingon ship withstood the new Breen weapon, and all Klingon power systems are modified accordingly, leaving the Klingons as the only line of defense for the alliance. Chancellor Gowron personally takes over the command of the Klingon fleet. Sisko sends Colonel Kira, who has experience in guerilla tactics, to support Damar. Although she would have to help her old enemies and especially the man who killed Tora Ziyal, she accepts. Odo and Garak accompany her. Bashir finds out that Odo is suffering from the Founder's disease too; he suspects that it could have been developed by Section 31. He and O'Brien further investigate the case, and they are startled to discover that Section 31 infected Odo in the first place to carry over the virus to the Great Link."
"Tacking Into the Wind","S07E22","Odo's condition is worsening, but he hides it from Kira. On Deep Space 9, Chancellor Gowron orders useless Klingon suicide attacks on the Dominion, obviously to discredit Martok, who has become too popular. Worf is upset. When Martok refuses to overthrow Gowron, Worf challenges Gowron and kills him in a fierce bat'leth duel. He then declares Martok the new Chancellor of the Klingon Empire. The efforts to find out more about the Breen energy damping weapon continue. Damar's resistance group manages to capture a Jem'Hadar attack ship on which the weapon is being installed. Rusot, one of Damar's closest friends, endangers the mission when he threatens Kira, and Damar has to kill him."
"Extreme Measures","S07E23","While Odo is staying in the infirmary at DS9, Kira leaves with Garak and Damar to continue the Cardassian resistance movement. Time is pressing to find a cure against the Founder's disease. Bashir lures Sloan to DS9, and he plans to use an illegal Romulan memory scanner to probe Sloan's mind. Sloan, however, commits suicide before Bashir can find out anything about the Founder's disease and a possible cure devised by Section 31. With 43 minutes left until Sloan's death, Bashir and O'Brien link themselves to his brain, and they are walking through a virtual environment resembling the corridors on the Defiant and DS9 and with a manifestation of Sloan, who attempts to stop them. They finally find a kind of office in which Sloan hides many secrets, among them the decisive information about the disease."
"The Dogs of War","S07E24","Sisko takes command of the new Defiant-class ship USS SÃ£o Paulo, which he is authorized to rename ""Defiant"". The ship is equipped with countermeasures against the Breen energy damping weapon. The Dominion destroys most of Damar's resistance movement, and claims that he himself is dead. The Cardassian civilians, however, are convinced that their new hero is still alive, and the resistance finds new supporters everywhere. Grand Nagus Zek, who has initiated social reforms on Ferenginar, decides to retire. To Quark's surprise, he declares that Rom should be his successor. Sisko learns that Kasidy is pregnant."
